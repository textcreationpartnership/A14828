            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Mongſt many Letters and Treatiſes that haue come vnto my hands con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the matters in queſtion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Secular Prieſts and the Ieſuits: one of moſt moment, pyth, and ſubstance (in mine opinion) is this enſuing Dialogates diſcourſe. Which by ſo much the more meriteth my poore commendation in gracing it with a generall Preface: by how much as it is in a ſort an Abſtract, Compendium, or a Breefe of all, and the moſt important matters that are in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſie betwixt vs and the ſaid Span. or Ieſuiticall faction. For (omitting other perticulars) you haue here exquiſitely hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, The great contentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> about ſuperioritie arrogated to the Ieſuits ouer the Secular Prieſts: you haue here diſcuſſed, The queſtion about Schiſme; and the vnlearned, but very malicious libels of Fa. <hi>Lyſter</hi> the Ieſuit, couertly confuted. You haue here deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, The caſe of obedience and diſobedience; and, what ignorant obloquie the common ſort of Catholicks haue the Secular Prieſts in, for they know not what themſelues, but a forgery filed with Ieſuiticall lying lips, which hath giuen it a glaſſe of a ſtainleſſe die, in a ſenceleſſe conceit of infallable truth, to reſt in the bare words of a wretch vnworthy the naming, for the honour of Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood mightily preiudiced by him. You haue here ſet downe, The cauſes of the Ieſuits double dilligence in defending the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieſt; together with their many vnhoneſt, vncharitable, irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious,
<pb facs="tcp:1970:3"/>
vnpriestly practiſes for a ſupremacie. You haue here inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated vnto you, The Ieſuiticall vnspeakable pride, ambition, enuie, mallice, extortion, crueltie, and aboue all, their more intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable backebiting tongues for inuectiues against whome they hate, than euer had <hi>Ouid, Horace,</hi> or any other malignant de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractor, ſcold, or Cinicall ſlaunderer. In few, you haue here ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planed, The grounds of all the Ieſuiticall calumnies, defamations, and iniuries, wherewith their apparators, ſumners, and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers haue and doe still vex, torment, and crucifie Christ his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants with their tongues, in as mercileſſe a purſuit as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people of the Iewes (at the Scribes and Phariſies instigation, ſuggestion, and egging forward) purſued our Lord and master Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Christ himſelfe, on earth amongst them. Theſe with many the like points of importance are here very learnedly treated of: whereby to giue all Catholickes (as well priests that are not of the deepest reach: as alſo and most eſpecially the laitie, both men and women, marvellouſly ſeduced, blinded, and led into error by the Ieſuiticall faction) to vnderstand, what may doe them good, if they list to accept of it in theſe daungerous times of our common calamities: how and wherein they are to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure or ſuſpend their iudgement, vntill they heare the caſe deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: and who they are, <hi>ſcil.</hi> the ſecular prieſts or the Ieſuits, that haue most offended the ſtate, preiudiced both Pope and Prince, giuen greateſt ſcandale, and incurred the higheſt diſpleaſure, with deſert of ſharpest puniſhment to bee inflicted vpon them at the hands of God and man. And for to giue the deuout Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke reader a little tast for an antepaſt of this enſuing diſcourſe, I deſire nothing more than that which the noble Senatour deſired of king <hi>Auener</hi> his ſoueraigne, to wit, that all paſſion, affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and partiall doome ſet aſide, choller, haſtineſſe, and the furie of that part and third portion of and in man, called <hi>pars iraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibilis,</hi> ſhut vp in priſon, committed to cloſe keeping, in ſilence for the time; and reaſon ſet on the throne of iustice, in the court of a good conſcience, to iudge of all things as they are in their own proper kind, vprightly weighed in the ballance of equitie and iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
<pb facs="tcp:1970:3"/>
without colluſion in the matter, ſophiſtication in the worth or falſhood in the weights, vnequally proportioned: to conſider with me theſe few points following, euen for Gods loue, for the reuerend regard all true Catholickes haue or ought to haue to eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry annointed priest, and for their owne vertuous intents ſake, as deſirous not wittingly and willingly to be led away with error, nor to conceiue amiſſe of well meant endeuours.</p>
            <p>The first calumniation here handled, is Diſobedience, laid to the ſecular prieſts charge, by the ſeditious Ieſuits: wherein theſe points are to be conſidered: firſt, how that theſe two disiunctiue conſorts, Obedience, and Diſobedience, doe the one of them follow the other by as neceſsary a ſequele as the ſhaddow dooth the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, when either the obiects they both reſpect, or els the ſubiests wherein they are inherent, stand in oppoſition by contrary quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, properties, or motions: <hi>verbi gratia:</hi> A man ſeruing two masters at once, the one as Emperour of the ſea in the field of warre; the other as high Constable, Seneſhall, or Lord Chaunce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor of the Realme, &amp;c. in the land of peace: If theſe two com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund <hi>ſimul &amp; ſemel,</hi> an act to be acted by their ſaid ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant, agreeing to their place, office, and calling; the obedience to the one must needs inferre a diſobedience to the other, in that ſame action. But if withall theſe two great commaunders bee aduerſaries: then is the caſe most cleare. And this was the cauſe why our Sauiour ſaid that <hi>Nemo poteſt duobus dominis ſervire, &amp;c.</hi> And by conſequent then it may be inferd by an argument made by way of compariſon, That it is impoſsible to be obedient to the See Apostolick, but that by neceſsary ſequele, the ſame obſeruant must diſobey Maſter <hi>Blackwell</hi> the Archprieſt: And the reaſon is: for that our diſobedience in the caſe propoſed as in controuerſie betwixt vs and him together, with his great masters the Ieſuits, conſiſts in this, <hi>ſcil.</hi> That we would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of no innouation, or new institution, or authoritie, which is not conformable to holy Apostolicall, Eccleſiasticall, Canonicall custome decree and order in elections, without his Holineſſe ſpeciall Bull and Breue, for allowing, ratifying, and confirming
<pb facs="tcp:1970:4"/>
of the ſame. But Maſter <hi>Blackwels</hi> authoritie was in that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of oppoſition, in many points contrarie to the churches Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons and Apostolicall order: <hi>Ergo,</hi> the obedience to the See Apostolicke in reſistance of him as an Archp. at the firſt: must needs be an act of diſobedience to him, in not acceptance of him as our lawfull ſuperior. Againe, in another ſence, our obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in the foreſaid caſe in controuerſie, conſiſts in this, <hi>ſcil.</hi> That we would not admit of any ſuch authoritie as might im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach vs of any diſloyaltie by act, word, or thought, in things wherein our dutifull obeyſance was requiſite, or whereby wee might be iustly ſaid to haue ſtained our religion with treaſon, or entangled our priestly function with princes affaires: but this authoritie of Maſter <hi>Blackwels,</hi> hath drawne him and the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits together, with all the confederates, conſpirators, abettors, and aiders of him and them in it, within the compaſſe of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, by reaſon of the platforme which is for inuaſion; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the compaſse of a premunire, by reaſon of his preſumed autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, to make laws and exerciſe <hi>jura regalia ſiue in ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liabus ſiue in temporalibus: Ergo,</hi> our obedience to her Maieſtie, in reſiſtance of the Ieſuiticall Arch-prieſt, with deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all ſuch vnnaturall plots, drifts, and intendments, as were approued to lie cloſe couched in his authoritie, being ſo much the greater, by how much as the ſaid traiterous pretences were masked with a ſeeming religious zeale; muſt needs be an act of diſobedience to the ſaid Archprieſt and his fellowes (ſubiects of Father <hi>Parſons,</hi> as <hi>Garnet</hi> and others) in the highest degree of contempt, that ambition frustrated of aſpiring hopes, can imagine to haue poſsibly beene offered vnto them. Secondly, there occurreth then alſo to be well weighed, the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt a ſubordinate and a ſupreame authoritie to commaund, and therewith alſo the like difference to obey. For although obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience be due in all inferiours to their ſuperiours: yet, with this prouiſo by cuſtome, practiſe, courſe, and order of all lawes, <hi>ſcil.</hi> That if the inferiour ſubiect be wronged by any ſubordinat of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall, or magistrat, hee may alwayes appeale for iuſtice from
<pb facs="tcp:1970:4"/>
that ſubordinate court and authoritie to a higher office and offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer aboue the preſident incumbent: and ſo in order from one to another, vntill he come to the highest ſupreame or ſoueraigne in cheefe. And ſo we ſay that <hi>in ſpiritualibus</hi> obedience is due in euery pariſhioner to his Pastor, but yet in order, vnder his Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop: of euery Dioceſean to the Biſhop of that Diocaeces, &amp;c. but yet in order, vnder the Pope or vniuerſall Biſhop. And againe, <hi>in temporalibus</hi> obedience is due in euery inferiour ſubiect to the meanest officer placed in authoritie vnder his ſoueraigne, but yet in order, first, to all ſuch as are ſubordinate one vnder another to the ordinarie Iustices of the peace, but yet in order, to theſe vnder the high Commiſsioners, and to theſe in order: to the Lords of the Honourable priuie Councell: and to them all in order vnder the ſoueraigne or ſupreame Maiestie: and then by conſequent the Ieſuits and their Archpresbiteran or Spaniſh faction inueighing against the Secular Prieſts, for appealing to the See Apoſtolick for iuſtice <hi>in ſpiritualibus</hi> and to the regall throne of ſacred Maieſtie in defence Apologiticall of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocencie <hi>in temporalibus,</hi> doe peruert all lawes, cuſtomes, and orders, and arrogate to themſelues a dignitie, preheminencie, and authoritie aboue both Pope and Prince: and are thereby guiltie of high treaſon, with many blaſphemies breathed out by the ignorant multitude vpon this occaſion againſt them both. Thirdly, there doth here occurre to be conſidered, the nature, qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, and condition of thoſe acts which are to be enacted, exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, and performed vnder obedience to that legifer, promul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gator, or other commaunder ouer his ſubiects. For that, ſuch may the act be in it ſelfe, as no power on earth may lawfully commaund it: and if there doe, yet ought it not, neither may it (without incurring mortall ſinne) be obeyed. For example, If eyther Pope or Prince doe commaund their ſubiects or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to commit inceſt with their owne mother, or to murther their parents, or to commit any other act, which in it ſelfe is euill, and as we ſay, <hi>intrinſice malum:</hi> no diſpenſation, pardon, nor placard, can euer make that act to be iustifiable
<pb facs="tcp:1970:5"/>
and good, although it may be forgiuen before God and man, <hi>quia miſerecordia ejus ſuper omnia opera ejus.</hi> And ſeeing God can forgiue more than man can offends then <hi>a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiori,</hi> mans offence to man, may and is more eaſily forgiuen. Conformablie then hereunto, for as much as the Pope him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe may bee lawfully reſisted and diſobeyed in cauſes tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall: eſpecially, when the matter concernes the vtter ſubuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a whole Common-wealth: nay, of many mightie king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes (as this platforme laid by the Ieſuits, doth aime at no leſse, in ſuggestion to his Holineſſe for the Spaniards inuaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:) therefore doth it neceſsarily follow, that this act of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to our Soueraigne, as wee are Engliſh ſubjects, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of her royall perſon and our natiue land, doth take away all the least ſinne or offence that can be imagined by our diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to the ſame See Apostolicke for ſo doing and actuall reſiſtance, made against his Holineſſe, or any forraigne power that ſhould come with hostile hand to pierce this Realme. Nay, ſeeing it was oracled from thoſe diuine lips that were blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie to thinke they could either erre, diſſemble, or poſsibly lie, <hi>ſcil.</hi> that <hi>Reddenda ſunt Caeſari quae ſunt Caeſaris, &amp;c.</hi> And ſeeing that Maxime holds irrefragably ſure, that <hi>non eſt faciendum malum vt inde eveniat bonum (poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis ponendis inter bonum &amp; malum:)</hi> I ſay then that it were a ſinne, and a most great and greeuous breach of the law of God, of Nature, and of Nations; and he or ſhe to bee holden for traitors, that vnder any pretence ſhould occaſionate the conqueſt of their natiue land, or (ſtanding as the State of England doth this day) ſhould not defend it, <hi>dentibus &amp; enſibus &amp; vſque ad ſanguinem,</hi> euen while one drop of bloud were left in his bodie. This Hipocriticall ſhew and vaine vaunt of religion, together with the Ieſuits masked pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of reſtoring the Catholicke Romane faith, are as farre wide from the matter or any likelyhood of the Churches flouriſh by that bloudie meanes, as the conuerſion of a ſoule is impoſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, after it is once out of this mortall life. Thus then you ſee
<pb facs="tcp:1970:5"/>
what a vile, malicious, and moſt ſottiſh, couſening, and ſence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe ſlaunder it is, that the Ieſuits and their ſeditious brokers haue raiſed of the Secular Prieſts and other Catholicks, that will not rub on their loftie banke of ambition and vnnaturall aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piring conſpiracie: euery one, lad, and laſse, tag and rag; and as well the ignorant as thoſe of more wit, but no leſſe mallice, vpbraiding prieſts, with diſobedience to their Superiour, when they neither know what obedience nor diſobedience is, nor when, to whome, or wherein it is, or is not due. Yea, ſo ſenceleſse they are herein, That if eyther the Pope and the Church, or her Maieſtie and the State, would take them at the worſt: they might all bee iuſtly condemned for erronious and trayterous perſons, by their owne cenſure applied in the premiſses to theſe two contraries.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Slander or calumniation here handled, is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famies, obloquies, and reprochfull words in paſsages giuen out by the Ieſuiticall fastion against the ſecular priests. And for that I verily thinke neither <hi>Zoilus, Ariſtarch, Timon,</hi> or other Miſanthropos, euer equal'd, or els was to be compared with a Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit in the damnable art of detraction or enuie: therefore doe theſe points occurre herein to be duly conſidered of euery deuout Catholicke. First, what great contempt theſe wicked men haue brought Priesthood into, by this most vngodly meanes: which I thinke there is no auncient Catholicke in England this day, of any compaſsionat religious mind, whoſe heart dooth not bleed to behold and to thinke on the difference betwixt the reuerend regard had in times paſt, and at this preſent, as well by one prieſt of and towards another, as by the Catholicke Laitie in generall to all prieſts, without this newfangle Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſaicall moſt daungerous exception of perſons, &amp;c. For what Catholick, before theſe Ieſuits got footing in England, would not haue trembled at the heart to haue called an annointed Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke Prieſt (howſoeuer he had earſt liued) a Knaue, a Villaine, a Spie, a Southſayer, an Idolater, a Schiſmaticke, a Libertine, an Apoſtata, an Atheiſt, with other the moſt odious tearmes
<pb facs="tcp:1970:6"/>
that the diuell or mallice is able to inuent? And yet than this, nothing is more common now euery where amongst this leaud brood of the Ieſuiticall faction: our common aduerſaries euen of their owne humanitie, and for ciuilities ſake ſhewing a more reuerend esteeme and reſpect to be had of prieſts (at least for their learning, ſcholariſme, morall vertues, and other good abilities noted in most of thoſe, had by that faction in diſgrace) than any of theſe new peſtiferous Puritanean Ieſuiticall Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries will eyther acknowledge, or giue any ſigne to bee had of them. All the wonted benedictions of prieſts now are reiected, their prayers, their ſacrifices, their hallowes, and their holies, contemned; and whatſoeuer elſe they doe, pertaining to priestly function and authoritie (though in neuer ſo bad perſons, yet to be reuerenced, remaining in the Catholicke Church) deſpiſed, as of no valliditie, worth or efficacie, more than if the ſaid Prieſts were but lay perſons. Loe what a readie way theſe miſchieuous men haue made for Antichrist, vnder pretence of their Phariſaicall zeale. Secondly, it is to be conſidered, That the end theſe vngodly polliticke ſet the ignorant multitude on gog for againſt Prieſthood and the Secular Cleargie, is onely and wholly to withdraw all Catholicke hearts from them, to themſelues and their ſocietie; with more like diuelliſh than humane mallice in them. And to make it ſeeme more plauſible and eaſilier ſeaſed on in weake idle braines: they poſseſse their inconstant, flexible, wandering thoughts with follies, ſcruples, and feares; as, That the Secular Prieſts are become prophane Publicanes and groſse ſinners, vnlearned, ignorant, infirme and weake men, of no reach, iudgement, nor conſcience in things; that they runne on without making any account or reckoning of ſinne: that they haue no authoritie, but all is lost they had, by their bad demcanure: that they remaine Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholickes onely in ſhow for the time, but are indeed very A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſts (for ſo the ſpeech will neuer out of my mind which one vſed of Doctor <hi>Bagſhaw</hi> in the Gate-houſe, after his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to Wisbich, tending wholly to this infamous kind of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant
<pb facs="tcp:1970:6"/>
backbiting) that they are daungerous men to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued into any mans houſe, &amp;c. All theſe, with many the like most impious ſpeeches and ſlaunders are here touched, as rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by that faction againſt innocent men, bleſsed Martyrs, and reuerend Prieſts, euen from the beginning (of enuie in a Ieſuits heart, to ſee any doe well that followed not them) to this preſent houre. And now they heaue at all in generall, whereas before they maligned but ſome certaine prieſts in ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall: whereof my poore ſelfe haue taſted ſo great and heauie an ouer-weight, as euen enuie, mallice, and themſelues might ſeeme with ſhame to keepe ſilent hereafter, and horror of their account appaule them for the wrong they haue done me. But yet I liue, and ſo I muſt a while, maugre the deuils mallice and all the Ieſuits that hate me. Thirdly, it is furthermore to be well weighed, That their enuious proceedings herein, is moſt pernitious to all thoſe Catholicks, euen whom they beare moſt in hand of all good meant on their partie vnto them. For who doth not ſee it, that the onely cauſe of this their infeoft emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation at the Seculars good hap, riſeth vpon this, That God ſweetly ſo diſpoſing, as their innocencie beeing knowne to her Maiestie and Honourable Councell, together with the Ieſuits trayterous hearts, they finding more fauour than the Ieſuits do, and thereby leſse daunger incurred by thoſe that doe receiue them: the Ieſuits very pollitickely (but moſt impiouſly, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciouſly, and vnprieſtly) imagining that in the end, this courſe taken, would occaſionate all the Catholicks in England to ſide with the Secular Prieſts, and vtterly renounce the ſayd Ieſuits: for their moſt ſafetie, they haue no other ſhift nor meanes in the world to auoid this eminent daunger of perpetuall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ile out of England (as their like practiſes cauſed their odious baniſhment out of Fraunce) than to beare the people in hand, That her Maieſtie and the State meaneth no fauour nor good to be extended to the innocent more than to the guiltie; that the Secular Prieſts are but vſed as ſpies; that the State intendeth to get out of them what they can, and then to cut both them
<pb facs="tcp:1970:7"/>
and thoſe they conuerſe with all off together. And for thoſe and like reaſons are the Secular Priests (ſay they) very daunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous perſons, and ought not of any Catholicke to bee truſted. Which moſt vile, vncharitable, and wicked ſpeech of theirs, is ſo much the more ſenceleſse, by how much as it implicats a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction; as in this enſuing diſcourſe will appeare at large. Meane while it is to be conſidered, Whether <hi>Daniell,</hi> or <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dras,</hi> or <hi>Zorobabell,</hi> or <hi>Tobias,</hi> or <hi>Eſther</hi> in the time of the Iewes captiuitie, or the ſweet Paranimph or <hi>Ioſeph</hi> of Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mathia, or the mournefull <hi>Magdalen,</hi> or the choice veſsell of election in the ſorrowfull prime-birth of the Church her infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie: or yet Saint <hi>Sebaſtian,</hi> Saint <hi>Martyn,</hi> S. <hi>Bernard,</hi> S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> S. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> S. <hi>Clare,</hi> or any other, in time of the like heauie calamities in the Catholicke Church to theſe of ours, finding extraordinarie fauour with God, and grace with men more than others, yea perhaps farre before them, or at leaſt their equals in vertue and true Catholicke religious zeale, could find, that were in the ſame predicament with them of diſgrace; were they (I ſay) to bee condemned by other Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke Chriſtians in theſe dayes, for that they found more friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip at the ciuile Magiſtrates hands, than others could? Was <hi>Daniel</hi> thought to be a rebell, or <hi>Eſdras</hi> a ſpie, or <hi>Zoroba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell</hi> an Atheiſt? Or good <hi>Tobias</hi> an Ideot, or Queene <hi>Eſther</hi> a make-bate: for that the firſt was made Generall of thoſe Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours forces, vnder whom (as captiue) he liued: the ſecond in ſpeciall eſteeme, truſt, and affiance with the ſame princes: the third ſent home with great treaſure, to build vp the ruinated Temple and Citie: the fourth often ſpared, being taken in the exerciſe of his countries rites, ceremonies, religious acts, and other workes of charitie, which moſt of his fellowes if they had been taken tripping in, had been ſure to haue died for: and the fift and laſt of theſe, obtaining mercie, grace, and pardon, not onely for herſelfe, but alſo for her whole countrey, people, and Nation, proſcribed all to death irreuocable, by falſe ſuggeſtion of <hi>Haman</hi> the traitour? Againe, Was bleſsed S. <hi>Iohn</hi> euer
<pb facs="tcp:1970:7"/>
the worſe, for being not onely admitted into the iudgement hall by permiſsion of the higheſt Prieſt: when all the reſt of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiours Apoſtles were forced to flie away (or elſe had beene ſure by all morall coniecture to haue in the Iewiſh furie, taſted of their Lord and maiſter his cup of torments at leaſt, if not of death:) but alſo being then free, and neuer once examined what he thought of his maiſter Ieſus, he was able of his bare word to bring in his fellow S. <hi>Peter:</hi> who, if an vnhappie girle had not been, might haue ſtayed there ſtill, without any ſinne or of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence committed by that action. And yet in and by a Ieſuiticall cenſure, they had been certainely condemned as ſpies, if they had eſcaped ſcotfree as S. <hi>Iohn</hi> did, and S. <hi>Peter</hi> might, if no worſe matter had happened vnto him than that his perſonall preſence there. Was good old <hi>Ioſeph</hi> thought to bee a Statiſt, or ſhould our bleſsed <hi>Ladie,</hi> or <hi>Nicodemus</hi> (as timorous as moſt of our Engliſh ſchiſmatickes are) haue had a ſcruple or doubt of beeing betrayed in going to take downe and entombe the bodie of God, her onely Ieſus, becauſe the ſaid Aramathian found more than ordinarie fauour at the high prieſts hands, in obtaining of him, to burie it where he thought good? Was the bleſsed <hi>Magdalen</hi> ſuſpected to bee a worſe woman, for that, that ſhe was permitted of the ſouldiours to paſse and repaſſe to and from the ſepulchre vntouched of them? Was Saint <hi>Paule</hi> condemned of any one, for hauing leaue (being priſoner) to goe where he lift, for any to come to him that would, and for that <hi>Feſtus,</hi> that <hi>Felix,</hi> that king <hi>Agrippa,</hi> and others, vſed him kindly, often ſent for him, and would not permit his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treymen the Iewes to haue their bloudie will ſatiated when and as they deſired. In few, were any of theſe that found more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour than their fellowes in any time of perſecoution, ouer heard of to be iudged, cenſured, and condemned as ſpies, as daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous perſons, as reprobates, or fallen from their faith, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this day? No certainely. The Ieſuits amongst many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novations in the Church of God, haue brought this in first of any other for one, <hi>ſcillicet,</hi> That all men fortunes, gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb facs="tcp:1970:8"/>
fauours, and actions whatſoeuer, ſhould bee euill thought of, which were eyther beneficiall to any, without a commoditie to their ſoeietie; or not ſquared, agreeing to their trecherous proceedings, or but onely done without their conſent, ratibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, allowance, and liking. Well, as their pride, their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie, and their mallice hath been vnspeakeable herein: ſo their teares, their bloud, and all their liues (if they were giuen and bestowed in recompence and way of ſatisfaction) will neuer bee able to rince out that ſtaine of their good names, which they haue charactered in their torne conſcienceleſse heart, and credite, which they haue loſt thereby in the hearts of all other vertuous, wiſe, and ſound Catholickes, naturall Engliſhmen and women of all degrees.</p>
            <p>As for their other generall ſlaunders: That the matter in contention was once alreadie decided at Rome, and therefore would they make the world beleeue, That the Secular Priests were ſeditious, turbulent, and factious perſons: and alſo, That they (the ſaid Priests) are the onely Stateſmen and meddlers, ſtatizing more daungerouſly than they (the ſaid Ieſuits) doe Hispanize or Spanifie, &amp;c. the one and the other, are both most falſe, meere calumniations, forgeries, and ſlaunders, without any truth in the report or broachers of them abroad: and very ſenſibly, prudently, and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly are they here confuted, and their ſhamefull dealing, trecheries, and impietie, couertly diſcouered thereby; toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the foysting in of that poore ſimple man, Maiſter <hi>Blackwell,</hi> into an office and authoritie, hee little knew (God wot) what it meant, or what treaſonable practiſes were intended to bee wrought by him. Finally, there doe here occurre to be well conſidered (as a point in my mind of as great a drift, moment, and conſequence, as any wee yet touched) the panigeries of the Ieſuits praiſes, the cauſes moouing them to ſend foorth their ſpirits to courſe both ſea and land with bugle blaſts of bloudie <hi>Bellonaes</hi> menaces, to all that dare preſume to contradict a Ieſuit: and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame
<pb facs="tcp:1970:8"/>
follie, madneſse, lunacie, or what to tearme it (I know not) in ſundrie of the Catholicke Laitie, yea, and of the more vnlearned and leſse experienced ſort of Priests, that will beleeue euery word to be an Oracle that falleth from a Ieſuits lips, (in ſo much as once one ſayd: That if ſuch a Priest, a follower and factor of the Ieſuits faction, ſhould bid him hang himſelfe, he would doe it) that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be otherwiſe perſuaded, but that all the whole Church and Common-wealth of Christendome depends vpon theſe impotent aſpirers: that stand stiffely in it as a thing impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, how euer the Secular Priests ſhould preuaile against ſuch rare peereleſse Sance-peres: that thinke it no way a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing to Catholicke Christian doctrine, how euer ſuch pure illuminats (who haue, as they ſay of themſelues, a more neare familiaritie with God, than any other priests) ſhould euer faile in points of faith, good life, gouernement, and order in all things: that their liues, words, and acts haue beene touched to the quicke, and euer hetherto haue been found faultleſſe, spotleſſe, and (as a man might ſay) immaculate without crime, for to the ſame end dooth one Father <hi>Holtbies</hi> ſpeech in a rayling letter tend, (as writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to a Catholicke ladie, of no leſſe nobleneſse for her ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, than for her bloud) against all the Apellants in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, but against a reuerend Prieſt (maiſter <hi>Muſh</hi> by name, whoſe bookes <hi>Holthie</hi> is vnworthie to carrie) in ſpeciall: that they are the moſt learned, the moſt prudent, the moſt vertuous, the most religious, the moſt what not perfection on earth is in a Ieſuit; with the contraries in all others to be found. Theſe ſtraunge paradoxes, as they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage a high marke, which the Ieſuits aime at, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall a heauie ruine, ſo doe they demonſtrate a ſenceleſſe, witleſse, and idle braine in thoſe that doe beleeue them, that cannot ſee into them, that will not be informed of their daungers by following their vnnaturall faction, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall
<pb facs="tcp:1970:9"/>
prognosticate a ſorer, abſurder, and a more miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheeuous hereſie (if not Antichrist himſelfe) to bee brought in by them, than euer yet was heard of in the Christian world, to this houre. For how is it poſsible (vnleſſe the dolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous date of mans miſeries be well nigh ſpent, and wee the miſerable wretches, reſerued to liue in theſe heauie dayes of the Churches last calamities) that euer any iſsuing out of <hi>Adams</hi> loines, ſhould be ſo ignorant of Natures frailetie in man, as theſe Ieſuit fautors ſeeme to be by this ſenceleſse at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing vnto them a state of innocencie in a ſort aboue that wherein our Plaſmist created our protaplast in terrestriall Paradiſe?</p>
            <p>Mans wit, though it haue ſuffered a great diminution by our protoparents fall, as all the rest of the parts and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers in humane nature haue, (yea, euen ſynderiſis is not exempted, but ſeemeth in many to be extinguiſhed, rather than to haue any being at all) yet theſe ſparkes of Natures light are left in our ſoules, <hi>ſcil.</hi> Firſt, to be of ſo high ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitie, inſatiable longing, and touring reach in ſearch after diuine knowledge, as nothing can content the vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding or intellectuall part of man, ſaue onely <hi>ſummum bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num, ens entium,</hi> eternall felicitie, beatitude, God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe and no more: which euen Heathen Philoſophers, <hi>Plato, Ariſtotle, Socrates,</hi> and others, haue acknowledged, ſought for, and died inſatiable, becauſe they wanted faith to find it by. Secondly, the Diuell by naturall knowledge, perceiuing well in the law of kind, that couert barren could not make a band, thought it in vaine for him to tempt our protomother <hi>Eue,</hi> with eating of the forbidden tree, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe Father <hi>Adam</hi> could haue been drawne (as he was) to haue tasted of the ſame: and thereupon hoped the fiend (as it came to paſſe) to cut the entaile of his heauenly inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, cauſed our parents to make a conueighance by fine and recouerie to the deuill, a forfeiture of his tenure, a
<pb facs="tcp:1970:9"/>
breach of the conditions with his maker, a defeature of the heires male of his bodie for euer, and put the heires gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall to a deſperate forme-downe. Thirdly, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all this, That the originall writ of priuiledge was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked, and humane nature left to it ſelfe naked and vnar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med amongst ſo many enemies and allurements to impietie, as that thereby it came to that impotent degree wherein now it is: yet a light ſparke of Syndereſis, breaking out in the pure naturals of proper kind, moued euen Philoſophers, and ſuch as were onely conuerſant in naturall affaires, (pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing by lamentable experience the still continuance and vncured ſcars of that combat; which were, and ſo they are, Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, Error, Concupiſcence, Sinne, Sorrow, Hunger, Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie, Sickeneſſe, Death it ſelfe, and other afflictions found in themſelues, and vnacquainted with what they had lost in their first auncestor) to deplore the state of man ſo much, that they were not afraid to affirme, That Nature onely in the preduction of man behaued her ſelfe as a ſtep-mother, and not as a naturall parent.</p>
            <p>If Heathen Naturians could diue ſo deepe in finding euen by Natures instinct, the miſeries, infortunities, fraile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, imperfections, and impurities of man: if <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his Naturals, <hi>Plato</hi> in his Common-wealth, <hi>Cicero</hi> in his Orator, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in his Happie Man, <hi>Plinie</hi> in his Proaeme, <hi>Lactantius</hi> in his Epistles, <hi>Homer</hi> in his Odes, <hi>Empedocles, Democritus, Heraclitus,</hi> and other Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in their writings doe complaine of Natures vnkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in this point of imperfection left in man: if Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> against <hi>Iulian, Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> in his Stromateus, and diuerſe other Doctours, Legifers, and Hystoriors doe note this acknowledgement of humane imbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitie to be in theſe Heathen Wiſards, ignorant of the cheefe point which we Christians doe know and firmely beleeue to haue occaſionated theſe our downefals, imperfections, and
<pb facs="tcp:1970:10"/>
ignorance in all things: then what conceit ſhould Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans haue of mans ſtate, constancie, and ſickerneſs, in any, or all his actions: compared by holy writ in one place to a reed ſhaken with euery wind: in another, to a daungerous conflict in ſet battell: (for ſo ſaid <hi>Iob, militia eſt homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis vita ſuper terram</hi>) and in another, to a withered flower, to day freſh, to morrow in the furnace; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes like a weathercocke, chaungeable, wandering, and vncertaine.</p>
            <p>True it is, and cannot be denied, That the Heathens complaint was vniuſt, and proceeded of looſeneſſe, igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and mallice; eſpecially the blockiſh and beaſtly Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures, to whom, Natures infirmitie was ſuch a stumbling blocke, as they thereupon denied the prouidence diuine of God towards man, and all religion and reuerence of man to him againe. Yet the ſcope of my ſpeech tending onely to this, To bewray the Catholickes extreame follie, in conceiting the Ieſuits to be ſuch men of ſuch rareneſse, ſuch excellencie, ſuch worthineſse and perfestion, as (excepting our Sauiour Chriſt, as man, our bleſſed Ladie, perhaps S. <hi>Iohn Baptiſt,</hi> if the Ieſuits will giue me leaue) their like neither was, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is, neither euer will be found in <hi>rerum natura,</hi> from <hi>Adams</hi> fall to the worlds end. There cannot be a ſounder argument taken, to confirme, That the Ieſuits are but miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable wretches, and as impotent, weake, fraile, imperfect, and ſinfull men, as we poore Publicanes (ſo eſteemed of by them) are. Then this deducted out of the principles of Natures owne lawes, customes, and traditions in our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels: for Cat will to her kind: Bunten to his bay: Frie to his hole, and Man to his miſerie. And all this, by reaſon that the wound which was inflicted in the ſtate of innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, hath ſo feſtered in the whole poſteritie of <hi>Adam,</hi> as no hope of cure, during the time of mans mortalitie. And the tranſgreſsion of the firſt law-breaker, was ſo venomous
<pb facs="tcp:1970:10"/>
a ſeed to bring foorth wickedneſse in the race of man: that neuer any Legifer, ſpirituall or temporall, either by exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in themſelues (as a preſident to ſubiects,) or by any decree, ordinance, reward, or preferment for vertue, or pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naltie and puniſhment for vice, or any other engine or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument, cold root it out.

Neither any <hi>Abraham, Lot, Iob, Moyſes, Samuel, Salomon,</hi> or <hi>Adam</hi> himſelfe (that had taſted the difference of both eſtates, of innocencie and ſinne, of originall iuſtice and originall offences, of ſynde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall prudence and ſottiſh ignorance; and had preached of all theſe to the primitiue world) could by any exemplar, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together root it vp.

<pb facs="tcp:1970:11"/>
our Prieſt, Sacrifice, and Redeemer, that tende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, offered, and payed ſo rigorous a raunſome for mans re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, deliuerie, and demerites, that the leaſt part, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, and portion of his tres-ſacred, immaculate, and infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly valuable oblation; was both able, effectuall, and worthy not onely to haue cleanſed all mallice, rancour, and venome of ſinne, but the whole infection of all other infirmities and defects in any creature: would not for all that wholly take them from the world, but left them as a perpetuall penitenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all memoriall of a former euill deſert, to tontinue in this ſtate of pilgrimage: and as they were contracted by <hi>Adam</hi> in our firſt fall from innocencie in Paradice, ſo perfectly to be renewed by Chriſt in our laſt reſurrection to endleſse hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſse. The law deliuered to Angels, was tranſgreſſed in Heauen, before euer <hi>Adam</hi> came within a ken of Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, (if we follow the common opinion, That the Angels were created in that imperiall pallace) the law giuen to man in the ſtate of innocencie, was broken in Paradice ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restriall; the vnwritten law vnder the Patriarkes, the written law of <hi>Moyſes,</hi> the Euangelicall and most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect law of Chriſt, all haue beene broken, and too often violated on earth. Of this, all ages, all times, all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, all perſons of note and common ſenſe haue complained: God and Angels from Heauen complayned: Prophets and prudent Princes, wiſe and polliticke Regents, carefull and vetuous Gouernours on earth complayne: the Patriarckes and auncient firſt Fathers, before the Law; Priests; Princes, and Prophets vnder the Law; Chriſt his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, Diſciples, and all holy men in the Law of grace haue complained: the firſt man complayned: the laſt man will complaine: our Elders before (ſayth <hi>Seneca</hi>) hereof com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained: we our ſelues complaine: and thoſe that ſhall liue after vs, will complaine of mans miſeries, infirmities, fraile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, imperfections, and weakneſse in all things. And
<pb facs="tcp:1970:11"/>
ſhall any Catholicke then bee ſo blinded with an erronious conceit of an extraordinarie perfection of pieties, of religion, of deuotion, of familiaritie with God, of freedome from ſinne, of peculiar indowments with grace, for ſoule points, gouernment and inſtruction in all things, to reſt in a Ieſuit, aboue all other men on liue? Phy, Catholickes phy: let neuer ſo vncatholicke a thought take a momentarie repoſe vpon the buttreſſe of your breasts; or once ſincke into the centre of your hearts, leaſt you ſinke downe into hell without redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in ſo blaſphemous a thought as this were; and as too many of you haue beene infected, though not as yet I hope ſo peruerted as that you are remedileſſe impoſſible to be cured. If the Ieſuits will be Puritanes, and eſteeme better of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues than all their neighbours doe beſides; yet purita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize not you with them: leaſt they take incouragement by your ignorant applauſes, to proſecute their impious courſes, and ſo draw you on to attempt their owne and your destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; yea, and I pray God, not perdition alſo of bodie and ſoule, by running into ſome deſperate hereſie, with, or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them.</p>
            <p>What ſhould I ſay more? I am ſtill too tedious: for ſuch are the Meandrian paſsages in diſcourſe of the Ieſuiticall platformes, drifts, and deuices, as dayes, months, and years, would faile to ſet downe all the errors, calumnies, and prag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matickes vſed by them and their correſpondent conſorts, on their owne behalfe, againſt the Secular prieſts, and all that ayme not at the period of their fatall courſe: From which I beſeech God to bleſse, preſerue, and keepe all inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, ſincere, harmleſse, well meaning hearts; and to recall, reuoke, and deliuer all thoſe out of their ſnares, that are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie infected with their flatterie, falſhood, and follie.

               <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Ight VVorſhipfull Sir, my hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſalutations and Gods bleſsing to your ſelfe and your Catholicke familie. After my departure from you, I could not but vpon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of our long and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate communication, thinke it very needfull to ſet you downe in writing the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall points which had paſſed between vs in the ſaid conference. For I finding you to be of a vertuous and of a iuſt diſpoſition, by reaſon whereof you were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to iudge charitably of all ſorts; and had not ſuffered your ſelfe lightly and without proofe of things to bee caried away with ſuch reports as might be diſgracefull and iniurious to good men, and your old friends: I thought it my part to let you haue from mine owne pen the ſame in ſubſtance, which you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued from my mouth, that hereby in the relation of my anſweres, you might be kept from error, and my ſpeeches be free from miſtaking. Theſe times where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we are fallen, doe affoord vs plentie of humourous men; and thoſe no leſſe void of ſinceritie, than of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Chriſtian vertues. And very hardly are they to be found, which in matters of controuerſie tread vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly, and be diſpoſed to cenſure other mens words and actions, as they bee in truth, or as iuſtly they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue: but all rather value men and matters accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, as either blind affections lead them, or as by paſsion or priuate lucre they bee drawne to iudge or
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:1970:13"/>
report. VVhich ill diſpoſition, as it hath infected the moſt, ſo doth it not any where more apparently ſhew it ſelfe, than in this controuerſie fallen out betweene the Ieſuites with the Archprieſt and their adherents of the one partie, and vs ſecular prieſts on the other; wherein you ſee many run violently, and are caried headlong as a forceable ſtreame againſt vs, ouerbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring vs with infamies and ſlaunderous reports, vpon vncharitable ſurmiſes, vnlikely preſumptions, and vntrue ſuggeſtions, without reſpect of iuſt and due examination of our cauſe; or, as may bee feared in many, without regard of truth. Now mens iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are ruled wholly by fantaſies and conceits of perſons, by preſent taſts of gaine, or future hopes of preferment, or like temporall reſpects, to condemne vs before they know our cauſe: indifferencie is aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, equitie excluded, paſsion, partialitie, and a pleaſing humour beareth all the ſway: falſe reports are receiued as certaine verities, and they are repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the beſt, which in renting aſunder our good names, and in the office of defaming, doe ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues moſt eagre and vehement. It is a wofull thing indeed (as you often ſaid) to behold ſo great a breach of concord, and this ſcandalous deuiſion and ſtrife to be among Eccleſiaſticall perſons: but it is moſt hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible to ſee, what violent and vniuſt courſes are taken by men profeſsing ſingular pietie, vertue, and perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction aboue others, for the oppreſsion of many inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent prieſts, &amp; vtter ſubuerſion of their good names. No rumours that may diſgrace vs, are left vncaſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad; no ſlaunderous reports which may tend to our diſcredite, are vnuttered; no falſe ſurmiſe that may defile or diſtaine our good names, is kept from the peoples hearing. And finally, there is no man, no woman (as well of ſchiſmatickes and common ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, as of Catholickes) which our aduerſaries do not
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:1970:13"/>
entertaine, as fit inſtruments to be employed in this vncharitable worke of defaming vs: yea, to be offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and hot-ſpirited in this buſineſſe, cauſeth ſuch admirable alteration, that admit heretofore one had been reputed and ſhunned as a bad companion, or holden for a daungerous ſpie and traitor by our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries and their fauorites; admit hee were ſuch a one, as had publickely renounced his Catholicke re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and in open court renied the Pope, and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of the ſea Apoſtolicke; admit hee were ſuch a one, as by his whole life had giuen monſtrance of Atheiſme, yet his exquiſit diligence, his intemperate ſtickling, &amp; his furious zeale in blazing euery where our vndeſerued infamies, graceth him afreſh, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth him worthy the name of a good fellow, and to be reckoned by our brethren perſecutors, in the rank of a reaſonable honeſt man, thogh perhaps this good conceit &amp; fame muſt ſtand no longer, than this peece of their vileſt ſeruice ſhall endure. Your ſelfe good Sir, with all your Catholicke neighbors can witneſſe with vs, how hetherto wee haue concealed from you and kept ſecret all the matter of theſe contentions, being moſt vnwilling, and in troth very ſcrupulous, (though in our own iuſt defence) to impart vnto you any little portion of the cauſe or controuerſie, the notice whereof might certainely trouble your minds and breed you ſcandale, but could not benefit you in the ſmalleſt degree. Neither the matter only was thus carefully kept from you, but the parties alſo with whome wee had this lamentable conflict; leaſt vpon the long triall you haue had of our painefull trauels, and ſincere conuerſation among you (nothing agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to theſe ſlanders) you might take the ſmalleſt averſion, or any hard conceit againſt the perſons of our aduerſaries, that beare the name of religious men and Catholicke prieſts. But now that you are already
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:1970:14"/>
made acquainted with this contention, and with the parties alſo; and this not by vs, but by the Ieſuites, the Arch-prieſt, and the double induſtrie of their Agents; and that againe, contrary to the very law of God and Nature, they heape vpon vs dayly new in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famies before our cauſe be heard, or by any forme of iuſt triall and proceeding, we bee found guiltie, and convicted in the leaſt crime of hundreds, wherewith they vnconſcionably charge vs. It is needfull that we repell ſo notable iniuries, that wee ſtand in orderly defence of our good names and innocencie, and that we let you know the truth of our cauſe; to the end, that this preſent diſturbance of your peace, and the greeuous ſcandale giuen throughout the realme by theſe contentions, may redound to them or vs, as ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they or we ſhall bee found by iuſt examination and indifferent iudgement to haue been the authors and cauſers thereof. And truly Sir, wee would haue been vnwilling and very loath to haue defended our owne good names in any publicke manner, becauſe we could not poſsibly doe it, without touching the imperfections of our owne deare brethren, which in theſe hard times of perſecution, and in this lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble affliction of our Church for the Catholicke faith, we earneſtly deſire to ſpare and not to touch, though with any reaſonable loſſe to vs; if our brethren would haue taken vp themſelues in any time, or haue kept any meaſure in afflicting vs. But you ſee our ſilence hath been ſo long, our patience ſo great, that thereby we haue not onely ſuffered much detriment in our credits and eſtimation throughout the realme, but moreouer we haue loſt many friends; which through ignorance of our cauſe, the violencie of religious men and ſeminarie prieſts with their adherents, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to run againſt vs, are fallen from vs. This patience of ours alſo hath made (which is the worſt) our aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:1970:14"/>
more audacious and violent in their vniuſt courſes. In all which proceedings of theirs, we could neuer hope for ſtay or ſtint, till they had vtterly ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed our good names, vnleſſe in time we ſhould make ſome lawfull reſiſtance and encounter: which though perhaps we haue vndertaken it too late, yet we doubt not, but in time we ſhall recouer ſome part of our loſſes, and at the leaſt in the iudgements of honeſt, vertuous, and indifferent perſons, bee freed from the infamies, after they ſhall haue once exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined and aduiſedly waighed the cauſe on both ſides, without partiall and blinding affections. In this onely our aduerſaries haue the aduauntage of vs, that they can eaſily couer the wrongs they doe vs with a plauſible cloake, and name of their religion and authoritie, and with inuectiues againſt vs, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt enemies to their order, and diſobedient to our owne ſuperiours: which two bad diſpoſitions, if thorow their ſlaunders they be once beleeued, or conceiued to raigne in vs, they muſt procure of neceſſitie vnto vs the auerſions and hatred of all Catholicke people and honeſt natures. VVe be Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke prieſts, and albeit our carriage in Gods worke hath beene heretofore neuer ſo good and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reprehenſible, yet the very bare name or coat of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and the very remembrance of authoritie, ſwaieth much in mens opinions, to the diſcredite of any that contend with religious perſons and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours, although their cauſe bee neuer ſo iuſt, and the actions of the religious or ſuperiours bee moſt iniurious. But yet who is he, that experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced but a little in the affairs of both former and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ages, can bee ignorant, that the religious by too much ſeeking themſelues, may ſwarue from the perfection of charitie, which they profeſſe to run at: and that men placed in authoritie, may alſo
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:1970:15"/>
tranſgreſſe the lawes of equitie in the execution of their office, and then they are accuſtomed in the worſt ſort to oppreſſe their ſubiects, when they moſt pretend iuſtice, and in ſtrongeſt manner ſound forth the cries of their authoritie, for better colouring ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by their vniuſt violence. And ſurely the abuſe of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie is not to be feared, nor ſuſpected more at any time, than when in controuerſies, refuſing or hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring all iuſt, all indifferent, all ordinary triall by laws or comprimiſe, they leane wholly to their authoritie, and ſtriue alone by it to ouerbeare and ſubdue their ſubiects. And in like maner alſo, the religious are then to be doubted moſt of ſincere dealing, when only by a vaine-glorious conceit or vaunt of their religious eſtate and perfection, they iuſtifie themſelues before the world, and would beare out all they doe againſt their neighbours. Thus farre in part we talked, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the anſweres I made to euery particular report you told me of; which I will here ſet downe: and to auoid the tedious repetition of quoth you, quoth I, will deliuer the ſame vnder the names wee haue by our ſeverall callings, both of vs true Catholickes, I a ſecular prieſt, and you a VVor. lay Gentleman.

               <p>If we looke what men of their place and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation ought to doe, or againe what good opinion is due vnto them in regard of their ſtate, I alſo am of your mind, we ſhould ſuppoſe the beſt of them.

But if on the other ſide you enter into the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſie betweene them and vs, and examine truly, and ſincerely waigh what we haue done, and what they report, you ſhall find our actions much contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to their ſlaunders, and no cauſe to thinke all they ſay to be Goſpell: but you will iudge it neceſſary ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to feare the worſt, than to ſuppoſe the beſt of them. Let vs ſee then how theſe religious men, with the Arch-prieſt and their favourites prooue vs to be ſchiſmatickes, diſobedient, and rebellious: obiect for them I pray you, what you haue heard them alledge againſt vs.</p>

And as in that refuſall you were ſchiſmaticks, diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, and rebellious at the firſt, ſo are ye now guiltie of great diſobedience to your Arch-prieſt for not

            <sp>

               <p>Here be two things, our forbearing to accept of the new authoritie, or to ſubmit our ſelues to the Archprieſt; &amp; our diſobeying the Archp. decrees and precepts. Touching the firſt, the Ieſuites and Archp. haue ſo vehemently thirſted our diſgrace and infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, that for our delay, they cenſure vs to be ſchiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickes, and as ſuch vile perſons to be vſed, and ſhun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of all Catholickes. And albeit the deciſion of this queſtion belonged nothing at all to them, but was to be had from the ſee Apoſtolicke and ſupreme paſtor of Gods church, before whoſe ſentence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, no man was to be condemned of ſo foule a fault, or puniſhed for the ſame with publick infamie, and the loſſe of his good name; yet could not the good men ſo long containe themſelues, nor repreſſe the violence of their ſpirit, as to ſpare our credites, and to forbeare the ſubuerſion of our honeſt fame, till they had informed his Hol. of the caſe, and had receiued a firme ſentence from him, what he iudged of the caſe, and how he would haue them to proceed againſt vs. This temperance, this modeſtie, this cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie they would not vſe, but taking hold of our delay and themſelues iudging it as a fit occaſion, and a cauſe ſufficient ynough whereby they might worke our diſgrace and ignominie, they prevented the ſee-Apoſtolicke, and gaue ſentence of vs, that wee were Schiſmatickes. And that this raſh and vncharitable iudgement of theirs might run with more credite euery where, they ſet on work one of their principall men, Father <hi>Thomas Lister,</hi> Doctor of Diuinitie, to write a Treatiſe againſt vs, wherein he went about to proue vs to be ſchiſmatickes in the higheſt degree. Now this rude and infamous libell, as void of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning as it ſwarued from truth and modeſtie, being once divulged, it was approoued by Fa. <hi>Garnet</hi> their
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:1970:16"/>
Prouinciall and by the Archp. and forthwith confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the practiſe of them and their adherents; we and our people were borne downe with ſlaunders, ſhunned as you know in all conuerſation, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famie was currant euery where. Thus then they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued vs to be ſchiſmatickes by a ridiculous pamphlet, and by the practiſe of their owne erronious opinion.</p>

               <p>But I heare, notwithſtanding all their heat then, and the heapes of iniuries they caſt vpon you by this ſlaunder of ſchiſme, that both the Ieſuits and Archp. in England, and alſo Fa. <hi>Parſon</hi> in Rome, are now halfe aſhamed of the matter, and ſay it was but one priuate mans opinion, and that hereby they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer defamed you to be ſchiſmatickes.</p>

               <p>I heare alſo, that now, when they perceiue the matter is like to come to triall before the higheſt Tribunall on earth, and to be made knowne vnto the Chriſtian world how they haue iniuried vs, they
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:1970:17"/>
would ſtep backe againe, and with any ſmooth and cunning ſhift make men beleeue, they had not ſo foulely erred, and broken the bonds of all Chriſtian charitie. But the caſe is cleare ynough, their actions were manifeſt to all our nation, and will convince them of too intollerable impudencie, if they denie that which all men know them to haue done. VVee haue alſo their owne hands to teſtifie againſt them: but in ſuch men, if the teſtimonie of their owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences will not ſuffice to make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> confeſſe a truth, though it be to their own temporall confuſion, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when their fact is knowne to a whole nation, as this is, they may keepe themſelues content with the bare name of Religion; and for humilitie, for morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, for charitie, for ſinceritie, and true ſimplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, let them not boaſt themſelues aboue the meaneſt Chriſtians, nor glorie in theſe vertues at all. And if the Archp. ſay or write (as I heare he doth) that hee neuer called vs ſchiſmatickes; I cannot but lament his caſe, conſidering we haue his own letters and decrees to the contrary, whereby he doth charge vs with that crime, and forbiddeth vs in any ſort to defend our good names; not we, but they ſhall reprove him. And for both the Ieſuits and him, if they be now come to this, That it was but a priuat mans opinion, neuer vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered to the diſcredite of any; they giue the world, which knoweth the contrary, ouer great and manifeſt preſumptions to feare their bad dealing in all the reſt. And moreouer, I demaund of them, VVho it was that wrote their infamous libell of ſchiſme? VVas it not the Ieſuit Fa. <hi>Liſter?</hi> VVho ſet him on worke? was not this his ſuperior Ieſuit Fa. <hi>Garnet,</hi> as Fa. <hi>Liſter</hi> himſelfe confeſſed? VVho approoved it, and ſent it abroad to ſome of our prieſts? VVho but Fa. <hi>Garnet</hi> and the Archprieſt? who ſaid it ſhould be defended, if we would bring it to triall? VVho but Fa. <hi>Garnet?</hi>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:1970:17"/>
VVhence came the copies thereof to bee ſcattered among the Aſsiſtants, and in all corners of the realm, but from the Ieſuits and Archprieſts? VVho finally were the authours and ringleaders to the reſt in the ſcandalous practiſe againſt vs, and our children? VVho but Fa. <hi>Garnet</hi> and the Archprieſt? Moreouer, if they ſay it was but one priuat mans opinion, this maketh their fault more inexcuſeable: For wee that held the contrary, were many, and not altogether ignorant. The caſe then in practiſe ſhould haue been ruled for vs, and we ought not to haue been defamed vpon one priuat mans opinion.</p>

               <p>I thinke it muſt needs be graunted, that the ſuperior Ieſuit and the Archp. were acquainted with the libell. For the Archp. approued it: and for the Ieſuites, conſidering that their cheefeſt vaunt and glory of their religion dooth conſiſt in a ſingular perfection of obedience, wherein they would hee thought to excell all other religious orders, it cannot be imagined, that any of them, but eſpecially not Fa. <hi>Liſter,</hi> a Doctor of Diuinitie, famous among them for learning, a man for tenderneſſe of conſcience, much enclined to ſcrupuloſitie, and for humilitie and other religious vertues, accounted of extraordinarie perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction amongſt his fellowes it cannot be imagined (I ſay) that this Ieſuit of all other ſhould ſo forget him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and ſtaine the ſplendor of his obedience by ſuch wilfull raſhneſſe and indiſcretion, that he would euer enterpriſe a matter of ſo great moment and ſequell as this, before he had acquainted his ſuperiour Father <hi>Garnet</hi> therewith, and had conſulted alſo with him in euery particular, or finally, would divulge the ſame without his commaund and licence.</p>

               <p>If we ſuppoſe that this one good Father had in this groſſe manner forgotten euery point of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious obedience; can yet any man thinke, but that

his ſuperiour Fa. <hi>Garnet</hi> (if Fa. <hi>Liſter</hi> had not taken it in hand, and finiſhed it with his licence and liking, or if it had not been ſent abroad and practiſed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Fa. <hi>Garnets</hi> owne will and pleaſure) would forthwith haue eſpied the error and diſobedience of his ſubject, and haue recalled the tract, and hindered the practiſe thereof?

Or can we perſuade our ſelues, that in ſo great a matter and cauſe of tumult, the ſuperior Ieſuit Father <hi>Garnet</hi> ſlept all the while, and let his ſubiects ſay, write, and doe what they lifted: If this be ſo, where then was his vigilancie and ſolicitude?

               <p>I will doe it with a good will, and breefely. It is a doctrine generally receiued by all Divines and Canoniſts without contradiction, that the crime of Schiſme requireth neceſſarily an intended ſeperati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and rebellion from the head of the church, as he is head and ſuperior thereof, or from the members, as they be the members vnder that head.<note place="margin">2. 2. q. 39.</note> 
                  <hi>Schiſma est</hi> (ſayth S. <hi>Thomas) quo quis Summo Pontifici ſubeſſe renuit, cum quadam rebellione, intellige in quantum est ſummus Ponti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fex, &amp; membris eius communicare recuſat, intellige in quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum ei ſubiecta ſunt.</hi> Schiſme is that (ſayth he) whereby one refuſeth to bee ſubiect to the ſupreame Biſhop, with a certaine rebellion, (vnderſtand this) as hee is the ſupreame Biſhop, and refuſeth to communicat with the members ſubject to him, (vnderſtand) for that they are ſubiect to him. And againe, <hi>Schiſmatici ſunt, quiſubeſſe renuunt ſummo Pontifici, &amp; membris Eccleſiae ei ſubiectis communicare recuſant.</hi> They are ſchiſmatickes
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:1970:19"/>
which refuſe to be vnder the Pope, and to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate with the members of the church ſubiect to him. VVith this limitation ſtill, as <hi>Archidiaconus</hi> ſayth, <hi>Per recuſationem eius iudicialis ſententiae, non recognoſcendo ipſum vt Caput Eccleſiae,</hi> By refuſing his judicial ſentence, not recogniſing him for head of the church.

                  <note place="margin">Ver. Schiſma.</note> 
                  <hi>Notanter dixit, in quantum est ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus Pontiſex, id est, non recognoſcendo eum vt Caput Eccleſiae.</hi> S. <hi>Thomas</hi> ſaid purpoſely (in that he is Pope (that is) not acknowledging him for head of the church, <hi>Secus autem, in quantum ſingularis perſona.</hi> For it is not ſo, if one doe it in reſpect the Pope is a ſingle perſon; as if a man ſhould be offended with him for ſome particular fact.<note place="margin">Ver.

And therefore, if one doubt reaſonably whether this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſon be the Pope or no; and thereupon do not acknowledge himfully for the Pope, hee incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not thereby the crime of Schiſme, no though he erre in iudgement, becauſe there wanteth the forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of Schiſme, which is this, to refuſe him, as hee is vndoubtedly the Pope.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>C.</hi> 27.</note> And finally, the famous Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer <hi>Nauar, Schiſma peccatum est, quo quis ſe ſeperat ab vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate Eccleſiae nolendo ſubeſſe ei, vel membris eius, quatenus ſunt eius.</hi> Schiſme is a ſinne, whereby one ſeperateth himſelfe from the vnitie of the Church, by refuſing to be vnder it, or the members thereof, in regard they are the members thereof.

               <p>Doe you not? you know that our delay to accept of the authoritie, and to ſubmit our ſelues to the Archpr. was not becauſe we denied the Pope to be Pope, and our head; nor that we refuſed to obey him as our head; nor for that wee would not admit the authoritie, and Man ſaid to be inſtituted by him, formally, becauſe they were ſayd to be inſtituted by him. Vpon theſe reſpects, and formalities we delaied not, and yet without theſe we could not poſsibly be Schiſmaticks. But the whole controuerſie ſtood in this, That the authoritie was inconuenient for our Church; and that it was doubtful, VVhether in truth the authoritie was inſtituted by the Pope, or not. This was vncertaine (I ſay) the Ieſuits and Archprieſt on the one ſide had no Bull, no Breue, no Apoſtolick letters, no authenticall Inſtrument (as is vſuall in all matters, both of great &amp; leſſer moment, proceeding from that See, and which in graunts of extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie Iuriſdiction and Prelacie is abſolutely neceſſarie, before any bee bound in conſcience to obey them) they had no ſuch thing to ſhewe for proofe of that they claimed, and would violently inforce vpon vs, as his Ho. fact: and wee on the other ſide, partly for want of this Apoſtolicke VVrit and Teſtimonie; partly vpon other great reaſons, had good cauſe to doubt, that his Hol. was not acquainted with it: yea the particulars of the authoritie implied in them ſo many, and ſo great inconueniences, that we thought it needfull to delay the acceptance thereof, till his
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:1970:20"/>
Ho. ſhould haue better information of our Churches eſtate, and thereupon either recall the authoritie, if it were his deed, or in time reforme and change it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſome other more commodious to our afflicted Church. So that their propounding or promulgating this authoritie being inſufficient, &amp; no way binding vs in conſcience, we bare off to receiue it, becauſe it was vncertaine, and very likely not to haue bene in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted by the Pope. The inconueniences alſo which it brought with it were no little cauſe of our delay; and we bare not off becauſe we refuſed to be ſubject to the Pope, as Pope, or head of Chriſts Church, or to this, or any ſuperioritie he ſhould ordaine ouer us, as our ſupreme Paſtor, which yet wee muſt haue done before we had incurred the crime of Schiſme. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue you now how the caſe ſtandeth, and how farre off we were from being Schiſmaticks?</p>

               <p>Nay further we were ſo free from that crime, and all the leaſt diſobedience to the See Apoſtolicke in that delay of ours, (and of this neither the Ieſuits nor Archpr. could be ignorant, for they were priuie to our whole courſe, and actions in that matter, and they had alſo our owne word and hand-writing for ſubmiſsion in al things which were certainly notified vnto vs to be his Ho. his deed) that for men of their profeſsion, learning, modeſtie, and experience, to condemne vs, yea in the ſecrecic of their owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to be guiltie of ſchiſme, or the leaſt diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, cannot bee defended by any reaſon from the grieuous ſinne of temeritie, and raſh judgment. But for them by their toungs, penns, and practiſe to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſplay and caſt abroad in the world, the turpitude of this infamie for crimes faigned againſt vs by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and neuer once committed in thought by vs; and this alſo before the Church had examined, and

cenſured our caſe, this, this fact of the Ieſuits &amp; Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieſt, as it cannot poſsibly bee excuſed, nor eſcape the note of vncharitable audacitie, &amp; extreame cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie in them, ſo of neceſsitie muſt it bring woonder to all poſteritie, and be horrible in the ſight of all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt men. VVhen they vrged the admittance of the authoritie, with ſo many threats and in ſo violent a manner, as they did all that yeare before the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of the Popes Breue, we alwaies told them this, and we deliuered it them in writing. Firſt, that we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted of whatſouer the Pope had done already, or would doe in time to come in our Church. Againe, that wee would preſently and without delay receiue the new authoritie, and ſubmit our ſelues vnto the Archprieſt, if they could ſhew vnto vs the Popes let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and certainely make it knowne by any Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall writ or authenticall inſtrument, that the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie was inſtituted by him. Thirdly, we would in fact alſo doe the ſame without the ſhew of any Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call letter, if the Archp. and two of the Ieſuits would ſweare vnto vs, and avow it vpon their prieſthood, that this authority was ordained ouer vs by the Pope, or that his Ho. was acquainted with euery particular thereof. Againe, if they refuſed all theſe, wee offered further, preſently to obey the authoritie, vpon condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they would agree with vs to ſend one or two of either ſide to Rome, which might informe his Ho. of the ſtate of all, and bring vs certaine word what his will was we ſhould doe in every thing. Theſe procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings and offers of ours will for euer yeeld a firm and irrefragable teſtimonie of our ſinceritie, prieſt-like comportment, and innocencie in this cauſe; &amp; more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, protect and keepe ſafe our good names from the ſlaunders of our aduerſaries, in all degrees of ſchiſme or diſobedience, wherewith their ill affected minds by many ſleightie ſhifts and deceitfull preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

               <p>For my relation, our aduerſaries themſelues cannot denie it to be very true. For the articles were written and deliuered them, and toſſed in the hands of all Catholickes about London; they and their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents condemning them, wee and ours defending them to be juſt and indifferent. Touching their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition in this doing, I ſhall need to ſay no more but this; It had more be ſeemed religious men, not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing perhaps to bee eſteemed ſingular among others for good zeale, charitie, mortification, and wiſedome; and it had more graced an Archp. newly choſen to be a Superior, a Father, and a Patterne of vertues to vs all (ſuppoſe his authority had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:1970:21"/>
firmed by the Pope) to haue had patience with vs a while, and to haue expected the cenſure and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Ho. to whom only it belongeth to decide the controuerſie, before they had diſgraced and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famed vs for ſchiſmaticks and rebels againſt the See-Apoſtolick throughout the realm, and many parts of Chriſtendome alſo. And this (I ſay) they ſhould haue done for preuenting ſcandal, in caſe we had vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly been guiltie of thoſe crimes, and that our fault could not haue been couered by any handſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, or diminiſhed by ſome fauourable interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But for them to faigne and forge theſe crimes againſt vs; for them to be the firſt authors and divul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of theſe horrible infamies, which wee neuer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued in the leaſt ſort, that a ſincere mind can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe; for them to be the cheefeſt authors in the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of their owne erronious paradox; and this alſo before the Church had heard our cauſe, and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vs, (as I ſaid even now) I cannot perceiue how this could become them, or how it may bee juſtified by any meanes; it arguing a ſpirit as farre differing from charitie and diſcretion, as vices are oppoſit vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vertues. They are not ignorant neither (which greatly augmenteth their fault, and cleareth vs from all diſobedience) that it is an vſuall thing obſerved in all the particular churches and countries of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome, and by the light of naturall reaſon thoght neceſſary for the good gouernment of Gods people, that when any grace, benefite, office, or dignitie is granted by the people to any man; or when any au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie is inſtituted by him, which either was obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by ſurreption and wrong information, or contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in it things prejudiciall and inconuenient to their church and people; the Paſtors, Cleargie, and people doe deferre the admittance thereof, vntill they haue better informed his Ho. of all matters, and

               <p>Yea, and more than this; for they knew that many princes in Chriſtendome haue made lawes, and decreed, that nothing ſhall be admitted or put in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution within their States, that commeth from the Pope (we ſpeake not now of matters of faith, or man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners generally propounded, and commanded by his Ho. to be obſerued in the Church) before it be ſeene and approoued by men appointed for that purpoſe, as well to haue been rightly obtained, and to be au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenticall, as to bee without injurie or prejudice to any.<note place="margin">Variar. reſol. c.</note> This is obſerued (to let goe the reſt) in Fraunce and Spaine, as <hi>Couarruuias</hi> noteth in his booke.</p>

               <p>Me thinkes it is very neceſſarie it ſhould ſo be; for otherwiſe one badly diſpoſed man might by colluſion and wrong information obtaine that of the See Apoſtolicke, which would diſturbe and annoy a whole Nation.</p>

               <p>In ſuch caſes their laws are not thought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull, nor they which make or execute them, any way rebellious or diſobedient. The Ieſuits and Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieſt in a far leſſe caſe haue condemned vs of ſchiſme and diſobedience, when they could ſhew vs for this authoritie neither Breue nor Bull, nor any authenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call writ from the See Apoſtolicke.</p>

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:1970:22"/>
by your delay to accept the authoritie, to haue been meerely vntrue ſlaunders and calumnies; and theſe the more intollerable &amp; injurious, in that they were inuented, caſt abroad, maintained, and put in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the Ieſuits and Arch-prieſt, whoſe fame and bare name of religion and authoritie, would induce almoſt all men to beleeue them, &amp; to condemn you.</p>

               <p>So it is indeed, but yet if an Angell ſhould proclaime a true man to bee a theefe, and vpon the Angels word all men ſhould beleeue him ſo to bee; the juſt man were no theefe for all the multitude of beleeuers, &amp; the Angels proclamation were no leſſe than an vntrue ſlaunder and infamie. The like is in our caſe: yet with this notable diſparitie, that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentors and ſetters abroad and defenders of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famie againſt vs, bee but Ieſuits and an Arch-prieſt, which we know to be no Angels. But to conclude this part; our appealing at that time, and our ſending to Rome to know his Ho. his good pleaſure, leaſt in any thing wee might offend through ignorance in theſe vncertainties, manifeſtly ſheweth vs to haue beene free from all ſpot of ſchiſme, and diſobedience to the See Apoſtolicke. For ſchiſmatickes, not acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the Pope to bee their head, make no recourſe nor refuge to him, as to their ſuperiour: and rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and diſobedient perſons to the Pope, ſeeke not with ſo great paines and charges (as we did) to know his will, that they may conforme themſelues therun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. VVherefore this part of their report deſerueth no better name nor place, than the title &amp; predicament of an vntrue ſlaunder. Now, if yet you reſt unſatisfied with this that I haue ſaid, touching ſchiſme and diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, I referre you to our reaſons, and to the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which maiſter <hi>Champney</hi> writ to his friend concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this matter, and to M.

But againſt it I haue heard objected by your aduerſaries: Firſt, that the information was not truly ſet downe: And again, that their ſentence is not to be reſpected in this caſe, conſidering they be knowne aduerſaries to the Ieſuits, and would be glad by any occaſion, to diſpleaſure and diſcredite them.</p>

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:1970:23"/>
but ſhift haue they none at all to make it ſeeme vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truly deliuered.

               <p>In troth, me thinkes the caſe is very plainely and fully, and with great indifferencie put downe; and this ſhift of reprouing the information alwayes ſeemed to me and to many others, a meere cavill or friuolous wrangling; which is an vſuall thing to men that want ſubſtantiall matter to alleadge for excuſe of their fault; and when through lacke of humilitie they had rather ſtand to defend their owne errour, than acknowledge it. And in this caſe, verily nothing more moued my ſelfe and diuers others to conceiue very well of you and your dealing in this controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, and to feare ſome great defect of ſinceritie in your aduerſaries, than the prohibition which the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits and Archp. made againſt this cenſure of the Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boniſts; that none ſhould defend it, no, albeit it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded vpon true information of the cauſe. For what other thing could men conceiue hereby, but that the Archp. and Ieſuits, by whoſe aduiſe and direction he made and publiſhed that decree, intended to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe the truth by their power and authoritie; to beare you downe by ſtrong hand, and to ouer-rule our Church by their owne wils onely, without regard of equitie, reaſon, or conſcience.</p>

They were in cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite, authoritie was on their ſide, the world ſwayed with them, were it right or wrong they did, it ſhould be borne out by the cloake of religion, authoritie, diſobedience, and friends.

               <p>Suppoſing the information to haue beene true, the prohibition muſt of neceſſity be very groſſe and farre out of ſquare.

you ſpoke of. For when they reject their cenſure, and judge it worthie of no credit, becauſe (as they ſay) the Sorboniſts are enemies to the Ieſuits, it implieth, that they judge them to be men of that bad diſpoſition, that they will pronounce an erronious ſentence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to their owne knowledge and conſcience.</p>

               <p>But the Ieſuits ſeeme not to do any thing, nor at all to intermeddle with the affaires of you ſemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie prieſts, but they referre all to the Arch-prieſt: and therefore not they, but he and his Aſſiſtants on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſerue the blame, if any thing be done amiſſe.</p>

               <p>VVould to God it were ſo, that they were not intermeddlers, for then things would not haue come to this wofull plight in which they be now. But aſſure your ſelfe, it was not for nothing that the Ieſuits pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured this authoritie, and made choice of this man to be Archprieſt, and others to be aſſiſtants, all with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the conſent and knowledge of our Cleargie; and moreouer prouided by a ſpeciall caveat in the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, that in all matters of importance the Archp. ſhould take th'aduiſe and direction of the ſuperiour
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:1970:25"/>
Ieſuit in England. Againe, that the whole authoritie with the Archprieſt and Aſſiſtants, ſhould not be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute of themſelues, or depend of the liking or diſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of our Church next vnto his Ho. but alwaies be depending of the will of Fa. <hi>Parſon,</hi> as it ſhould pleaſe him to moue the Cardinall Protector to alter or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of all: for thus the Archprieſt, the Aſſiſtants, and all our Church are ſurely curbed. And laſtly, that the Ieſuits by ſuch violent means enforced vpon our Cleargie this authoritie, before it was confirmed by his Ho. or they had obtained any Apoſtolical letters, authenticall writ, or commiſſion to aſcertaine vs of the validitie thereof: aſſure your ſelfe (I ſay) that all this was not done in vaine by theſe men of ſo rare prouidence, but all their diligence and endeauours tended principally to this, at this marke they aimed, That not only they might be exempted from al ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination to any ſuperiour in our Church, but alſo haue the greateſt ſtroke in ruling our Cleargie, and ſitting cloſely at the helme, ſteere the whole ſhip, turne, and diſpoſe of all as they liſted, and yet be not eaſily perceiued to haue any motion or meddling at all. And in truth ſo it is; the Ieſuits doing whatſoeuer pleaſeth themſelues, and cunningly vſing the Archp. his name, voice, hand, and miniſterie to any intende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or plot of theirs; they will not be ſeen authors or agents in any thing, but perſuade vs all to be obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to our ſuperior the Archp. The Archp. indeed and the Aſſiſtants are culpable, in that either they will not ſee the polliticke drifts of the Ieſuits, which tend to the ineſtimable diſaduantage and detriment of our Church; (for there was neuer the like miſerie and diuiſion among our cleargie &amp; people at home, and abroad in the ſeminaries, as hath beene ſince the death of the bleſſed Cardinall <hi>Alane,</hi> when the Ieſuits began pollitickly to ſtirre, contend, and rule) or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing

               <p>Me thinks it is very inconuenient, that there being theſe great contentions betweene the Ieſuits and prieſts, they ſhould haue any ſtroke at all either in the gouernment of our Church of England, or of our ſeminaries beyond the ſeas. For thus they may eaſily diſpleaſure both the ſtudents abroad, and the prieſts at home, againſt which they haue taken con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits, or with who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they haue had quarell at any time.</p>

               <p>It is ſo indeed, and this is the very bane of all our Churches peace. For many of our towardlieſt ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents beeing made made contents in the colledges, and hauing had contentions with the Ieſuits there; as they on the one ſide returne home poſſeſſed with humors of diſcontentment &amp; auerſions; ſo find they here the like diſpoſition in our Ieſuits to that their brethren had beyond; and their entertainement in England by theſe Fathers is vſually worſe and more intollerable than that which they ſuffered by thoſe in Rome or Spaine. But this is beſides our matter. Let vs returne to the ſecond part of the report (to wit) That we diſobey the Arch-prieſt. VVherin I pray you is this diſobedience of ours, deſeruing in the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of our aduerſaries, and their too credulous ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents, all theſe infamous outcries? name for them ſome particular, if you can.</p>

               <p>It is evident then that our Archprieſt is not ſo abſolute a ſuperiour ouer our cleargie, that he may commaund what he will; or that wee are bound to

               <p>True, but it is to be ſuppoſed, that hee will not in his decrees exceed the bounds of his commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and authoritie.</p>

               <p>VVe know hee ſhould not exceed them, but we may eaſily ſuppoſe an vntruth, if we ſuppoſe him or a greater ſuperiour than he, to containe himſelfe within his limits, when the caſe ſtandeth as this doth in a matter of controuerſie, wherein himſelfe is a principall partie: and when in all his proceedings hetherto he hath ſhewed a vehement deſire to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare all onely by ſtrong hand and authoritie.

               <p>Firſt it doth not appeare by the words of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, That the Archp. hath any authoritie at all to make new lawes and decrees at his owne pleaſure, which may bind vs to obey them; or for breaking whereof he may juſtly inflict vpon vs any penaltie at all.

               <p>The Archpr. cannot with any ſhew or colour of reaſon charge vs with diſobedience to him, except onely in that we obey not his decrees: we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge him for our Arch-prieſt, and to haue as ample juriſdiction ouer vs, as by his commiſſion hee can claime. In all things we are ready to obey him, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he hath authoritie to commaund. This one thing (through his owne, and the Ieſuits renuing it after it was once forgiuen and ended) reſteth in controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie between him, them, and vs, (to wit) VVhether by reaſon of our delay to accept the authoritie before it was confirmed by the Popes Breue, wee incurred
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:1970:28"/>
the crimes of enormious diſobedience, rebellion, and ſchiſme againſt the See Apoſtolicke or no. He and they auerre we did; we denie it: hee and they haue ſlaundered, and doe continually defame vs, as guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of thoſe ſinnes faigned by themſelues. VVe haue ſtood, and ſtand in defence of our aſſured innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie; and thinke it moſt violent iniquitie to bereaue vs of our good names vpon a priuat opinion of their owne, before our cauſe either at home or abroad be orderly heard and tried, and we alſo condemned by Gods Church. Hee and they forbid vs vnder moſt greeuous penalties, to defend our ſelues from their calumnies, or our good names from their vndeſerued ſlaunders: in which prohibition, becauſe it is very injuſt, we know our ſelues no way bound in conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to obey them. He and they ceaſe not to wrong vs, they keepe no meaſure nor meane in doing vs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries, but dayly oppreſſe vs with the heauieſt, and plainely intollerable afflictions: we being denied all hearing &amp; triall of our cauſe at home, flie by appeale to his Holineſſe. He and they exclaiming againſt this our fact, heap vpon vs all diſgrace and puniſhments: we arme our ſelues with patience againſt the worſt. Now you ſee all our diſobedience to the Arch-prieſt is in theſe two points. Firſt, in that wee defend our good names againſt his and the Ieſuits manifeſt ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. Againe, in that we appeale to his Ho. for ending the controuerſie, wherein the Archp. is a principall partie, and our violent aduerſarie. Both theſe I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe are directly againſt the Archp. his will and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees: (for his decrees are (as I ſaid) that wee ſhould not defend the ſchiſme and rebellion, wherewith he and the Ieſuits haue defamed vs, and that wee ſhall not appeale without his licenſe.) But to defend ones owne good name injuſtly taken away, is lawfull by the law of Nature it ſelfe: and to appeale to the See
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:1970:28"/>
Apoſtolicke from the injuſt oppreſſions of any ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour in the world, yea without his licenſe and againſt his will, hath euer been and will bee alwayes lawfull in the Church of God; and conſequently, it cannot be truly judged in vs any diſobedience to the Archp. when we reſiſt him and his decrees in thoſe caſes. For as he can make no law to ſubuert the law of Nature touching the defence of a mans owne good name; ſo can hee make no decree to prohibite or to hinder appeales from himſelfe to the Pope: and whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer he decreeth in theſe caſes, are of their owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture fruſtrate, and not to be obeyed by any.</p>

               <p>I grant all this, yet in the meane ſeaſon, whiles truth is by violence ſuppreſſed, the beſt that is may ſuſtain great loſſe in his good name. For there be few which either know or conſider how far a ſuperior is to be obeyed; and the moſt take euery oppoſition and repugnance to a knowne Superiours will or precept, to be the ſinne of diſobedience, without further diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſsion of things; and this the rather, in caſes where the Superiour and his Adherents are holden to be good men, and the marke they ſhoot at, is preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be ſome ſpeciall good thing, as the glory of God, peace, and the like.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gent.</speaker>
               <p>For pretences of good ends, no ſuperiour will fail to haue great ſtore, no not in the worſt things he commaundeth: and therefore me thinketh it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, that before any man be defamed (eſpecially by prieſts and religious men) of diſobedience and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion to his ſuperior, becauſe he reſiſteth his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement; firſt the thing commaunded bee loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked into, and tried whether it bee good or euill; if good, then againe it be conſidered, whether the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior haue authoritie or eommiſſion to commaund that thing or no. For if a ſuperiour commaund an ill thing, as to kill; or defame an innocent; to ſteale; or any thing againſt the law of God, of Nature, or of holy Church, he is not to be obeyed, neither is his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnance to be condemned for diſobedience. And againe, if he commaund a good thing, the which yet exceedeth the limits of his authoritie, a man is no way bound to obey; and his refuſall cannot juſtly bee called diſobedience. For otherwiſe I know not how our refuſall to obey our temporall princes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement for going to Church, and for practiſe of our religion, or any other magiſtrats injuſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement, may be excuſed or defended from the crime of diſobedience and rebellion in the Ieſuits

               <p>I will not judge theſe men to haue any ſpice of that diſeaſe, which our Saviour noted to bee in ſome men, That could ſpie a mote in their neighbors eye, but not diſcerne a beame in their owne: or that in cenſuring other mens actions, could <hi>excolare culi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cem,</hi> make bones of a Gnat; <hi>&amp; Camclum deglutire,</hi> and in their owne caſe eaſily ſwallow vp a Cammell. I will not condemne them for ſuch (I ſay.) But I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that once a Ieſuit told mee, how the Pope (vpon ſome great cauſe &amp; conſideration, doubtleſſe) ſent a precept or a decree to the religious houſes in Rome, thereby prohibiting vnder great penalties, That any ſhould vſe the knowledge gotten of a mans eſtate in the Sacrament of confeſſion, to any polli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke end, or matter in any externall affaire whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer. Thus much I remember he told me, for the reſt contained in the Apoſtolical writ, let it paſſe. VVhen it was brought to the Ieſuits, they ſingularly among all other orders would not preſently accept thereof, but required, that their generall might haue acceſſe and licence to deale with his Ho. before they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued it: the anſwer being brought to the Pope, forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with hee commaunded his decree or precept to bee receiued by them without further delay, vnder paine of excommunication, <hi>ipſo facto</hi> to be incurred. In this
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:1970:30"/>
caſe loe, when the matter concerned their owne par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, they thought it no diſobedience to refuſe for the time to accept and to ſubmit themſelues to this commaundement or decree of his Ho. in a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of ſo great importance. No, it was no fault nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (in their conceits) for them only to ſhew ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laritie in thadmittance of this decree of their ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior, and to make delaies in receiuing that which all other orders willingly admitted at the firſt. But in this caſe controuerſied betweene them and you, the good men I perceiue are more zealous and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and would bee loath to let eſcape any ſhew of diſobedience in you, againſt which they ſhould not exclaime and write to your greateſt diſcredite that may be.</p>

               <p>I alſo haue heard of ſome thing like to this, which you relate from the mouth of a Ieſuit, be it true or falſe; but this which I will tell you, is known to all Chriſtendome to be true. About eight yeares agoe it happened, that the Ieſuits had ſome diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentments with their Generall, and were deſirous to haue ſome things reformed in their order, for which cauſes they of Spaine labored to haue generall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation. The Generall with the Italian Ieſuits reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted their endeuors, and did what they might to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, for ſuch a capitulo or congregation had neuer been uſed among them, but at the election of a new Generall. This ſtrife was great, and continued long. And at the laſt the Spaniards, aſſiſted by the old king of Spaine, prevailed: and thereupon a generall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation was holden at Rome by commaundement of the Pope. Now this contention was betweene the Ieſuits and their Superiour, and they enforced him againſt his will (no doubt but vpon ſufficient cauſe) to haue this vnuſuall conuention. They had vowed obedience in the ſtricteſt manner; their Superiours
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:1970:30"/>
will ſhould haue been an Oracle, yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding they proceeded againſt him, and procured the thing they thought convenient for their ſocietie, whether hee would or no: by which practiſe of the beſt of their order it is manifeſt, that euen where obedience is vowed, the ſubjects may reſiſt their Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour his will and commandement, vpon a juſt and reaſonable cauſe; much more when there is no ſuch vow to bind: but if ſome of our Engliſh Ieſuits, or their whole ſocietie, for our diſgrace will condemne vs of diſobedience for reſiſting the Archprieſt in any ſort, or for refuſing to obey his decrees, of what qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie ſoeuer they ſhall be, we muſt return vpon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues the ſame reproch (but in a higher degree) for contending with their Fa. Generall in any ſort, or for any cauſe. Or if againe for credite of their ſocietie they liſt to excuſe their brethren, and free them from diſobedience in that contention, becauſe in many caſes the ſubjects may reſiſt their Superiours will or commaundement: if they doe this for loue to their owne credite, wee may entreat them for Chriſtian charities ſake to excuſe our fact, or to cleare vs of this horrible crime and ſlaunder of diſobedience for our refuſing to obey the Archp. in his decrees oppoſit to the lawes of nature and holy church.</p>

               <p>His authoritie is to puniſh prieſts for crimes committed, either by ſuſpending the vſe of their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, or by depriuing them altogether: as for ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending from the aulter, we thinke hee wanteth au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie.

For (ſay they) theſe with whom you deale, and of whom you find theſe ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar fauours, are profeſſed aduerſaries to Gods holy Church and to all Catholickes, and therefore it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but yeeld probable and very pregnant ſuſpition

                  <p>They be our aduerſaries, no maruell then if they ſpeake the worſt of vs they can, and vpon their euill affection take hold of every occaſion to ſurmiſe and report the euill we neuer did nor thought. You ſee how vpon their own priuat opinion only, againſt all right and conſcionable proceeding, where many as learned and judiciall as they, held the contrarie, they condemned and defamed vs of ſchiſme, rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and diſobedience (all Diuines and Canoniſts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue their fact, and all poſteritie will admire their impudencie, their want of charitie, or skill, or both) and in the reſt alſo their zeale, ſpurneth them for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to deuiſe and vomit out any thing that may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file our credites. Indeed their ſlaunders carie a great ſhew of probabilitie, becauſe they are in an odious matter, and ſeeme to proceed from an honeſt mind, zealous and ſincere: but let the particulars bee once diſcuſſed, and the vizard of deceit taken away, and then foorthwith the ſurmiſe and report will appeare in it owne likeneſſe to be a meere calumnie and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true ſlaunder. Firſt therefore, where they ſay that we bee men of daunger; it is the ſlaunder of an enemie, deſeruing no more credite, than their reaſon is of force to proue. VVhat is their reaſon then? Becauſe we are ſingularly fauored by the priuie Counſell and ſtate? Admit it bee ſo, is this ſufficient to prooue vs daungerous? If it be not, then is it a pernitious ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnie, to account vs daungerous for a cauſe which is not ſufficient to conuince vs to be daungerous. If it be, then muſt it follow, that not only ſome of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, but many alſo of their beſt lay friends in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland haue beene and are in the ſame predicament with vs. Had not Fa. <hi>Hawood</hi> Ieſuit ſuch extraordinary
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:1970:32"/>
fauour of the lord of <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> that (beſides the ſecret plottings &amp; conferences which were betweene them before the Ieſuits apprehenſion) when the Father was in durance in the tower, he only had there more libertie, and found more friendly vſage than all the prieſts in the other priſons throughout England: yea when many Catholicke prieſts were cloſely ſhut vp, rigorouſly vſed, and cruelly executed; Fa. <hi>Hawood</hi> lay at eaſe and ſafetie in the tower, and at the time of his baniſhment all men reported him to haue found ſingular fauours aboue the reſt touching his prouiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. This Fa. alſo had many conferences with Sir <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtopher Hatton,</hi> and receiued fauours of him before hee was apprehended? VVhat ſhould we ſay hereupon, that Fa. <hi>Hawood</hi> was a daungerous Ieſuit? Or rather, that theſe extraordinarie fauours are not ſufficient to proue a Ieſuit or a prieſt to be daungerous. Father <hi>Boſgraue</hi> another Ieſuit, found not he alſo extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie fauours in priſon and baniſhment, whiles many a good ſeminarie prieſt was ſtraightly handled &amp; put to death? I hope we may truly ſay, That neither ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Bluet</hi> nor maſter <hi>Clarke,</hi> nor any other of vs whom the Ieſuits and Archp. would diſcredite by acceſſe and familiaritie with the magiſtrats, haue as yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcended ſo farre vnto them, as that Fa. <hi>Hawood</hi> did; and yet was he not defamed thereby to be a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous man. VVe let paſſe the two ancient and famous Ieſuits, Fa. <hi>Langdale,</hi> and another, either of which had remained in the ſocietie aboue twentie years before their Apoſtacie, (which argueth that al Ieſuits be not Saints before they breake out of their order) wee let theſe paſſe (I ſay) and come to Fa. <hi>Iohn Gerard,</hi> who is ſaid to haue found more fauourable entreatie by our common aduerſary, during the time of his indurance, than any of our prieſts impriſoned in thoſe time, or than thoſe which now they ſo much exclaim againſt;
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:1970:33"/>
he is ſaid to haue ben abſent from his priſon, and this by licenſe 2, 3, 4. or mo nights and dayes together.</p>

                  <p>Thus much I alſo haue heard of him, &amp; that hee had more fauour and libertie than all his fellow priſoners beſides. But this was procured, as I heard, by great bribes, for he had alwayes greater ſtore of money than all the reſt.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Pr.</speaker>
                  <p>I condemne not the man, nor thinke him dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous for ſo doing. He found fauor among our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to haue libertie: if he be to be excuſed, or not to be judged daungerous, becauſe he procured it by his money; then, to find extraordinary fauour among the heretickes, is no true cauſe why a Ieſuit or a Prieſt ſhould be thought daungerous. And why ſhould not our prieſts in this caſe be as free from ſlander and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famie (if they can procure to themſelues by other honeſt meanes without money the ſame or more li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie) as a Ieſuit that bought it with his mony? I will not now rehearſe what ſome magiſtrats in high place haue ſaid of ſecret meetings &amp; conferences between ſome of the priuie counſell &amp; ſome Ieſuits; nor what ſome of the Ieſuits entireſt fauourits haue whiſpered to their friends, concerning ſtraunge plots and deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes for no trifles (I wiſſe) betweene the Ieſuits &amp; ſome of high roome and dignitie in the State. Be it true as they reported, or be it falſe, (as ſpoken but for a brag to win the Ieſuits mo friends and credit, as men able to diſpoſe of all) it much forceth not, all finally com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to this iſſue, That we be not daungerous men, becauſe we receiue extraordinary fauor of the ſtate. For if they alſo had conference, and withall hold this principle, themſelues alſo ſhould be dangerous men with vs, which they will not graunt: if they had not, yet in their conceits, and by theſe reports that they had, when the caſe is their owne, they thinke it no ſufficient cauſe to account them daungerous for fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:1970:33"/>
fauours and conferring with the priuie Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell: and ſo they acquit vs alſo of the ſame ſlaunder. For there can bee ſhewed no diſparitie nor reaſon, why this may not be as free for a Catholicke prieſt, as for a Ieſuit.</p>

                  <speaker>Gent.</speaker>
                  <p>You ſeeme to conclude this rightly, vnleſſe they wil ſay, that their dealing with the priuie Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, or the fauors they find of the State, cannot bring them into ſuſpition or obloquie to bee daungerous men, as it muſt doe prieſts; becauſe they are religious mortified men, faſt and ſure from corrupting or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prauing by the magiſtrates, as prieſts bee not, which are paſſionate men, looſer of life, and more incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, and therefore this daunger is more to be feared in them, and leſſe in the Ieſuits.</p>

                  <p>It may well be that they carry no worſe conceit of themſelues, nor better of vs than this: and I dare vndertake for them, that howſoeuer their charitie extendeth to vs, their owne good word ſhall neuer be wanting to themſelues. But theſe chimericall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits and fictions do not alter the nature of the thing we ſpeake of. And for ſeminarie prieſts in England, it is manifeſt, that they haue laboured in Chriſts vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard with no leſſe fruit, &amp; conſummated their cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in priſons and death, with no leſſe courage and zeale, than any Ieſuit hath done hetherto; yea, euen ſuch prieſts as theſe perfect Ieſuits, reputed to bee moſt imperfect (and with whom they haue had great contentions in the colledges beyond) haue matched them in the performance of all Chriſtian duties whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the triall was made, by enduring priſons, miſeries, and death. But as the huſwiues prouerbe goeth, All theſe fathers geeſe muſt be ſwans: They be Ieſuits, <hi>ergo</hi> peereleſſe.</p>

                  <p>I know no reaſon why they ſhould, vnleſſe perhaps the Ieſuits affection and conceit of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of all ſuch as they deale with, make this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, where in truth there is none. But yet they ſay that ſome of you goe voluntarily to the Biſhop of London, and haue dayly conferences with him, and other our aduerſaries; which thing is very ſuſpitious, and hath not beene vſed by any Ieſuite, or any of their ſide.</p>

                  <speaker>Prieſt.</speaker>
                  <p>Indeed the Ieſuits carry a higher conceit of themſelues than they doe of our prieſts, &amp; the ſame muſt others alſo carry of them, how ſmall ground or cauſe ſoeuer there be thereof, or elſe farewell friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and you are their aduerſarie. Correſpondent al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo hereunto, is the opinion and eſtimation which the Ieſuits and their people haue of ſuch every where, as depend vpon them, and haue yeelded themſelues into their guidance, in reſpect of all ſuch Catholicks as deale onely with the ſeminarie prieſts. For onely this dependance on them is cauſe ynough why they
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:1970:34"/>
ſhould bee thought mortified, zealous, perfect, and ſaints: and the reſt for want of this, paſſionate, dull, imperfect, and but ordinarie Catholickes, though in truth they exceed and excell theirs in the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of any Chriſtian dutie, excepting this onely, that they are guided by the prieſts, and haue not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned themſelues and all they haue to the wils and directions of the Ieſuits. And this fooliſh difference and friuolous diſtinction to be betweene the Ieſuits and their dependents, and the ſeminarie prieſts with their Catholicke people, is not obſcurely inſinuated, if it be not the principall ſcope aimed at in the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of <hi>Three fairwels,</hi> written by a cheefe fauourite of Ieſuits, but not without their priuitie, their peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and their conſent in publiſhing it abroad; for otherwiſe the Gentleman followed little of that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation and perfection hee talked ſo much on in that book, where he will haue a man in all things de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend of the Ieſuits, and to bee guided by them. As then no doubt he was himſelfe in moſt abſolute ſort, both in making and diuulging that gallant Treatiſe. But now that ſome of ours vſually reſort to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of London, and haue ſecret conference with him, I know not how farre the religious charitie and perfection of a Ieſuit, occupied in the cuſtodie of Euangelicall counſels, will aduenture to ſuſpect, judge, or report thereof; ſure I am they ſhould not haue proceeded thus farre as they haue done alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, if they had obſerued the rules and limits but of ordinarie precepts and Chriſtian charitie. VVe will not ſpeake now of ſuch prieſts as haue beene moſt officious for the Ieſuits and Archprieſt, in furthering their hard attempts againſt vs, and yet are knowne to come to the Biſhop of Londons houſe, no leſſe than theſe of ours which they ſo rattle with infamies. Let vs deale onely with theſe two of ours, M. <hi>Bluet</hi>
                     <pb n="46" facs="tcp:1970:35"/>
and M. <hi>Clarke,</hi> vpon which the ſlaunders cheefely run. Haue they not both been knowne for vertuous and good Catholicke prieſts, the one hauing endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a longer impriſonment for defence of Chriſts faith, than any Ieſuit hath ſpent yeares in England, yea, before any of that order entered the realme? Hath he not waxen old vnder that heauie yoke, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring the ignominie and affliction of Chriſts croſſe, aboue the glorie and pleaſures of the world? Hath hee not liued with great credit and honour among both Catholickes and Heretickes, which he purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by his Catholick zeale in defence of Gods cauſe, and by his ſincere, diſcreet, and vertuous comport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in his conuerſation? Hath hee now perhaps re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolted from his faith, or profeſſed himſelfe an enemy, or that in any the leaſt degree, he will bee rebellious or diſobedient to the See Apoſtolicke? Doth he not ſtill lie in priſon for his Catholicke religion? Or can they ſay perhaps that he wanteth abilitie, and the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents of wit or learning, by reaſon whereof hee may be thought incapable of promotion, or ſo inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to vndertake roumes of dignitie and liuings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong heretickes, that being fallen from his faith, or become a traitor to Gods cauſe, or what elſe ſoeuer the ſlaunderer will haue him. For thoſe defects of his they judge him unfit for preferments, and woorthie no better than this little libertie hee hath in priſon? Meaner men than M. <hi>Bluet</hi> or M. <hi>Clarke</hi> if they fall to the proteſtants, are friendly entreated, are ſet at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie, and preferred to benefices in their miniſterie, as is manifeſt in <hi>Dawſon, Maior, Bell, Tedder,</hi> and the reſt; what ill hap then haue theſe two to lie ſtill in priſon, and miſſe all aduauncement? For M. <hi>Clarke</hi> alſo, it is well knowne how he hath long and zealouſly trauel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led for the ſauing of ſoules, with no leſſe paines and fruit than the Ieſuits about him. Hee hath made a
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:1970:35"/>
more glorious profeſſion of his faith, and ſuſtained harder triall by affliction than many of them. Is he deuoid alſo of all ſufficiencie and good talents, that if he be gone from God, and all goodneſſe, hee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not yet (if he would) ſtep out of priſon to ſome fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter benefice among the miniſters? They that value their owne actions, how ſlender and trifling ſoeuer they be, aboue all that their fellowes doe, are very eaſily caried away, what by peeuiſh emulation, what by ſelfe-liking, into raſh judgements and diſgracefull reports, to miſconſtrue the words and deeds of them they fancie not; to interprete all ſiniſterly; and to take and cenſure all they ſee or heare in the worſt part they can deuiſe: affirming againſt both the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt rule of charitie, and the expreſſe commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, forbidding all raſh and temerarious judgements in theſe words:<note place="margin">

A good conceit or opinion, by the law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is due to euery man; and this ought all Chriſtians to carry in the ſecrecie of their owne hearts, each one towards other, vntill by ſome manifeſt and certaine fault one haue deſerued the contrarie.

Doctor <hi>Bag.</hi> whom
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:1970:36"/>
more than any, theſe religious fathers with the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieſt and their complices, haue diſgraced with ſlaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and to all the reſt of vs in durance, or abroad. It was due vnto them (I ſay) from all ſorts of Catholick people, from all prieſts, from the Archprieſt, from the Ieſuits: neuertheleſſe they haue bereaued vs of this treaſure and due. By what crimes manifeſt and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine haue wee loſt our right herein? How can they defend themſelues from cruell &amp; injuſt rapine? VVe were ſchiſmatickes ſay they: we denie it; and ſay it is no more but their own damnable calumnie &amp; ſlaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous fiction. VVe were rebellious and diſobedient to the See Apoſtolicke: we denie it; and ſay this to be an vndeſerued infamie, we neuer hauing the leaſt intention or thought (without which theſe horrible crimes cannot be committed) to ſeperate our ſelues from the See Apoſtolicke, or to diſobey in any thing <hi>Clement</hi> the eight: or any ſuperiour certainly knowne to be conſtituted by him ouer vs, ſo farre forth as his authoritie might appeare to be extended. And for this point, our innocencie is ſo cleare, that the Ieſuits and Archp. with all their adherents, ſhall neuer be able either by wit, or learning, or honeſt dealing, to proue vs guiltie of theſe crimes, or to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues from the foule note of vncharitable contume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious ſlaunder. VVere we knowne to be men of that bad life, euill demeanure, and corrupt conſcience, (for it could not be imputed to our ignorance) that without good reaſon, and all probabilitie of ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent cauſe, we were likely to forbeare the acceptance of the new authoritie till the comming of the Breue, &amp; wittingly to caſt our ſelues into a damnable ſtate? If our former labours and conuerſations had deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued this conceit, our aduerſaries might haue had ſome pretence to juſtifie their doings, and perhaps ſaued themſelues from the ignominie of detractors
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:1970:36"/>
and calumniators. But if not, as I hope the world will teſtifie for vs, then ſurely they ſhould haue take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther courſe, contrarie to this they tooke, as well for ſauing themſelues from greeuous ſinnes, as for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruing vs from theſe horrible infamies, into which they haue caſt both themſelues and vs, by their hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and raſh judgements. For truly, if any one reaſon of ours, or all together, be found a ſufficient cauſe of our delay, a heape of ſinnes &amp; infamies will redound vpon their owne heads, and we ſhall be freed. And now touching M. <hi>Bluet,</hi> M. <hi>Clarke,</hi> and others of ours, that are ſaid to haue acceſſe and conference dayly with the Biſhop of London, or ſome other of the Counſel.

                  <p>For the ſcandale, in reſpect of all the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Catholicks of England, the Prieſts and religious men eſpecially it is <hi>Scandalum acceptum,</hi> and not <hi>datum.</hi> For they knowing it to be an indifferent action of it owne kind, and to be juſtifiable and made good by many circumſtances, if they take ſcandale, before they ſee ſome ill effect to be intended, or neceſſarily to iſſue thereupon; it muſt be onely <hi>Scandalum accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum.</hi> And for the ſimpler ſort of Catholickes, they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo with their leaders are bound in conſcience to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect or judge no ill, of the indifferent actions of their Catholicke fathers and priſoners, vntill ſome ſinfull intention or effect appeare. And in this caſe much more ought the conſtancie of theſe Catholick prieſts impriſoned, as long as they perſeuer conſtant, to ſtay at the leaſt all good Chriſtians from temerarious or raſh judgements (which is euer a greeuous ſinne) and in this caſe is greatly encreaſed by the ſtate and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of theſe men, and by their former good deſerts and ſufferings; than they ſhould be moued by their acceſſe and conference onely, to ſuſpect or judge the worſt, or to vtter any thing derogatorie to their good names. The Ieſuits and Prieſts which are willing to ſet this ſcandale on foot, and labour what lieth in them, to make our prieſts actions ſeeme hainous and horrible, and neuer ceaſe to perſuade the people to judge the worſt, and to exclaime againſt them; theſe Ieſuits and Prieſts haue the more ſinne, and as they be the authours and continuers of the ſcandale, ſo haue they to anſwere for the ſinnes of their diſciples.</p>

                  <p>I thinke that the ſecureſt way: for as S. <hi>Iames</hi> (fourth) ſayth: <hi>Qui detrahit fratri, aut qui iudicat fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trem ſuum, detrahit legi, &amp; iudicat legem. Si autem iudicas le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem, non es factor legis ſed Iudex.</hi> He that detracteth his brother, or judgeth his brother, detracteth the law, and judgeth the law; but if thou judge the law, thou art not the obſeruer of the law, but the judge. A Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſaicall vice it is, raſhly to judge and condemn other men; and I wiſh the Ieſuits, the Archprieſt with their complices in ſlaundering vs, were free from all note and contagion of this turpitude. But if we throughly examine the cauſes which wee haue giuen them on our part, and with indifferencie weigh the nature of theſe actions &amp; their circumſtances in euery reſpect, whereupon the Ieſuits and their adherents haue jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and defamed vs of moſt horrible crimes, we ſhall eaſily perceiue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to haue tranſgreſſed the bounds of all Chriſtian charitie. A religious man is bound to tend and aime at Euangelicall perfection. This conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth not in the name of an order, nor in the three eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiall vowes of pouertie, chaſtitie, and obedience, to a Superiour: For hereby onely the principall lets and impediments which may hinder their attaining to perfection, are remoued. But perfection indeed,<note place="margin">

Now I demaund of the Ieſuits, what degree of charitie they haue ſhewed and exerciſed in this controuerſie? was euer any bad companions ſo diſſolute and impudent, and deſperate railers ſo void of conſcience and charitie, which vpon ſo ſlender cauſes and grounds, (firſt of our delay to receiue the authoritie, and now of hauing conference with the Biſhop of London or others of the Counſell) could euer haue run a more intemperate, headie, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:1970:38"/>
courſe of raſh ſuſpition and judgement, to the ouerthrow of our good names, than the Ieſuits haue done? Could they more haue exceeded the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of grace, of temperance, of modeſtie, of huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, than the religious Fathers haue? VVho in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters belonging onely to the ſupreame Paſtor to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide, haue taken vpon them to determine the cauſe: who with their own particular fantaſie haue preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the ſentence and judgement of the See Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke? and who finally vpon a priuat opinion of their owne (thought yet erronious by men, not their infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors for learning, judgement, ſinceritie, and other vertues) haue earneſtly laboured for euer to diſgrace and vtterly defame ſo many Catholick prieſts? Could any loſt or forlorne caitife haue made more vile and deteſtable inferences, or gathered more loathſome poyſon, or raiſed a more peſtiferous ſtinch, by ſtirring in theſe matters, and freely ſpending their mouths in condemning and defaming prieſts for their confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences with the Counſell and Biſhop, than theſe reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious men haue done and their diſciples by their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample and onſetting? VVhat then auaileth a name and boaſt of religious perfection, when in obſeruing this ordinarie precept of not judging or not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning raſhly, they are ſo farre ſhort of matching the moſt of our imperfect prieſts, that they haue ſcarſely gotten one ſtep before the baddeſt Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans? Could not their charitie find any one cauſe or reaſon for excuſe of M. <hi>Bluet</hi> and M. <hi>Clarkes</hi> indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent action, till ſome worſe effect appeared? VVas it needfull for their charitie, to preuent their ill doing which perhaps will neuer fall out with moſt reproch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſlaunders. Infamies in the conceits of humble and charitable men, come timely ynough vpon Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke prieſts after they haue certainely done the fault, and in no wiſe ought to be caſt vpon them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:1970:38"/>
the crime bee committed. It is no hainous treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe in theſe extremities and wants of neceſſary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe in priſon, which by the Ieſuits and the Archpr. their meanes, is vncharitably brought vpon them, to ſollicite the Counſell or Biſhop for more enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or for continuance of the libertie they haue alreadie, or to procure the like to their afflicted bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren. If in this onely they haue found a little fauor, why then might not a Ieſuits charitie haue preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded or imagined this to bee the cauſe of their going and conference? Again, it is no crime to ſue for their owne and their brethrens baniſhment: if the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in theſe great and moſt grieuous miſeries inflicted vpon them by the Ieſuits and Arch-prieſt, as ſlaunders, penurie, loſſe of faculties, ſuſpenſions, and the like vndeſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued cruelties, aboue the common perſecution by their aduerſaries in faith, they ſeeke for their owne deliuerance by baniſhment: might not the religious Ieſuits and Archp. by this reaſon juſtifie, or at leaſt excuſe their going to the Biſhop? YVhat if their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions be to worke ſome good of theſe magiſtrats, either for their conuerſion, or to make them more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourable to afflicted Catholickes, and better concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of Catholicke courſes, yea, or to procure ſome tolleration or other good to our church? All theſe be lawfull ends, and might be more eaſily and with leſſe daunger of ſinne ſuppoſed by charitable men to bee their buſineſſe, till ſome worſe matter appeared, than the baddeſt diſpoſition and affair that emulous heads can deuiſe. Theſe and many moe cauſes of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences and acceſſe may bee without much labour thought vpon; all, or any one of which might be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient ynough to induce a timerous conſcience to deeme the beſt, or at leaſt, to ſtay it from the downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall of raſh ſuſpition, judgement, and defamation.

                  <p>This ſeemeth to be no better than an abſurd paradox. For it is fitteſt in my opinion, that greateſt reſpect and reputation be made of the ſecular prieſts and paſtors, which haue charge ouer ſoules, &amp; which by their ſtate and vocation are bound not onely to inſtruct well their people by Catholicke and whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome doctrine, but more ouer by their vertuous life and conuerſation to giue their people exteriour ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of well doing. A Ieſuit, or any religious man, after he hath preached his ſermon, after he hath cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſed the people, or heard confeſſions, or red his le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, or miniſtered any Sacrament, &amp;c. is not by his profeſſion bound to remaine ſtill among the people, and himſelfe to practiſe in open ſhew what hee had taught, and to be readie at all occaſions to helpe and counſell his auditors: but hee may and is by his ſtate tied to retire himſelfe into his cloiſter or colledge, where he may be thus, or ſo; good, or bad, as hee is diſpoſed: if good, to little edification in the world; if bad, to ſmall ſcandale, becauſe hee is hid and ſhut vp from the eyes of the people. Hee is not to looke or hunt for credit, it is ynough for him to be a religious
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:1970:42"/>
man, to obſerue the rules and diſcipline of his order, to preach good doctrine, and ſufficiently to miniſter the Sacraments he taketh in hand. But a paſtor, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides his diligent endeuours in teaching and diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the myſteries of God, muſt alſo at all times and in all occaſions, by his vertuous carriage giue a light vnto his flocke, what they are to do and imitate, or elſe he faileth in the performance of his dutie. And again, vnleſſe he haue good credit, and be well eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med among his people, neither his doctrine nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample ſhall much profit; men being naturally encli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned rather to imitate &amp; frame themſelues to a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner perſon, of whom they carry an high conceit, than to a better, whom yet they value not ſo much. And ſurely in my fantaſie the church is happie, and that people cannot but doe well, where the Paſtours and Prelates teaching and liuing well, are beſt beloued, honoured, and eſteemed of aboue all others. Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men are good condjutors, and deſerue praiſe, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and loue, if they tender the Paſtours credit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the people more than their own; if they draw the people more to reuerence &amp; obey their Prieſts; and if they endeuour to make a ſtrict bond of loue, honour, and vnion, between the ſheepe and their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie ſheepeheards. But if once they hunt after a ſingular name and credit, and within another mans fould, and aſpire to an eſtimation aboue the Paſtour, this breedeth diſlike, deuiſion, and contempt of the people towards their Prelate, and it cannot bee but culpable before God and man, as peruerting al good order in the gouernement of Gods church, and rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing ſecular Paſtors of their due. The religious at no time more deſeruedly win credit to themſelues, than when they ſeeke the honour and credite of ſecular Prieſts which haue charge of ſoules, and with humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of heart flie temporall eſtimation, and deſire to
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:1970:43"/>

But come when it ſhall, it is now before it come moſt expedient and neceſſarie for that day, that ſecular prieſts which muſt haue the charge when it commeth, be not vndeſcruedly bereaued of their credits and good names, but bee eſteemed equally with the Ieſuits, in reſpect of the charge and toiles they vndertake for ſauing of ſoules, not inferiour any way in mans eye, as now the game goeth, to the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie and trauels of theſe religious men.</p>

that it were good by ſome odde deuiſe to pull them down, and to diſgrace them; which things being cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly brought to paſſe, all would redound to the credit of their ſocietie, and thus all would goe round with them: might they not hereupon diſgrace and defame them too vpon any ſmall ſhew of offence?</p>

you it was a famous father of the Ieſuits, that in plaine words ſaid to a gentlewoman of good calling, which charitably reſpected the diſgraced prieſts, and was reſolued to ſtand indifferent to all, vntill the controuerſie were decided by the Church: Now (ſaid he) is the time of triall, they that are not with vs, are againſt vs (the good man would haue had her neither to releeue nor harbour any of vs, but to ſhun vs all, as rebellious ſchiſmatickes) if you forſake them not now, you will ouerthrow your ſelfe and all your po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteritie for euer.

For emulation, it is a friuolous toy; for admit any of vs were of that ambitious humour they report vs to bee, yet is there no ſuch good or pleaſure in the Archp. his authoritie, as any of vs ſhould emulate him for it, or deſire to haue it from him: neither ſince the beginning hath his carriage been in that office ſo commendable for diſcretion, ſinceritie, vpright dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling among his bretheren, moderation, prudence, compaſſion, and other vertues requiſit to bee in a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior, eſpecially in this afflicted ſtate of ours, that he hath giuen any man occaſion to enuie his credit, or couet the glorie of his actions.

<pb n="70" facs="tcp:1970:47"/>
by the cenſure of the ſame letter, all in print: for by Fa. <hi>Parſons</hi> wicked &amp; falſe information our two prieſts could neuer haue acceſſe to his Ho.nor audience, but were ſhortly after their arriuall apprehended as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table malefactors, ſhut vp ſeuerally in very cloſe pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon vnder Fa <hi>Par.</hi> cuſtodie. Fa. <hi>P.</hi> was the miſinformer to his Ho. Fa. <hi>P.</hi> was the guide to the officers that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended them. Fa. <hi>P.</hi> was their jaylor, their exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, the appointer of his brother Ieſuit to bee the ſcribe &amp; notarie. Fa. <hi>P.</hi> was the framer of libels againſt them, the procurer &amp; inſtructer of two Engliſh prieſts his deputies, to preferre his libels againſt them. Fa. <hi>P.</hi> was the inuentor, whiſperer, and ſoother of all bad matters, which might bring them in hatred: the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſer of the time and maner of their audience before two Cardinals, ſeuen weekes after their taking, the contriuer and moderator in all thoſe actions, the ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacker of all their writings and ſtuffe. Fa. <hi>P.</hi> would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer permit them to conferre together, nor the one to ſee the other, till they appeared before the Cardinall. Fa. <hi>P.</hi> prohibited them to haue a copie of the ſlaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous libels, which hee had cauſed to bee read in the Cardinals preſence for their diſgrace, or to anſwer to them. Fa. <hi>P.</hi> depriued them of all aduiſe and helpes of learned counſell.

And after (leaſt they ſhould returne to England, and tell tales of his crueltie and corrupt dealings) Fa. <hi>Par.</hi> plotted and deuiſed their miſerable baniſhment, the one into Paris, the other into Muſſipont in Lorraine. It was Fa. <hi>P.</hi> that in Rome laboured to diſcredit them and all our Cleargie, by carrying about and ſhewing their linnen ſockes, their handkerchifes, their night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coyfes, very meane in reſpect of ſuch as himſelfe and

Fa. <hi>P.</hi> diſmiſſed one many daies after the other, leaſt trauelling together, they ſhould haue too much comfort and helpe in ſo long a journey.

                  <p>Oh, they be Ieſuits, they muſt be ſtirring, and the true cauſes are theſe: They would not be ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinat in any manner to ordinary prelats in England, as to Biſhops, Suffraganes, &amp;c. but beare themſelues the greateſt ſway in the gouernment of our Church, and diſpoſing of all things. To exclude therefore all ordinarie prelates, which were to bee choſen by voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and common conſent of our cleargie, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented vs ſecretly, by getting an Archp. to rule ouer all, except themſelues. This authoritie was of their
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:1970:49"/>
owne deuiſing; the man preferred thereto of their own election; in whoſe gouernment alſo and actions, they prouided, that themſelues ſhould haue a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall ſtroke; that forſooth in euery matter of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance the Archp. ſhould haue the aduiſe and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the head Ieſuit in England. Thus their wils ſhould be fulfilled without checke, in all they liſted to attempt or deſire.

                  <p>This is a raſh and vncharitable calumnie: For no man can be an enemy to religious perfection, but thereby he falleth from Gods grace. For albeit no man out of vow be bound vnder mortall ſinne, to obſerue the Euangelicall counſels, yet can no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian hate the obſeruers of them, or become their enemie for that reſpect, but hee offendeth mortally thereby. If therefore it be certaine, that we be their enemies, it is no leſſe certain, that the cauſe is not any part of religious perfection to be noted in them: for otherwiſe ſhould we be enemies alſo to the religious men of other orders, as to Dominicans, Franciſcans, Benedictines, Carthuſians, and the reſt; in all the which, no man except a Ieſuit, will denie as much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious perfection to bee found, as is among the Ieſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its; yea, we ſhould be more enemies to all them than to Ieſuits, if this were the cauſe that mooueth vs in this caſe. For all theſe haue the eſſentiall vows of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie, chaſtitie, and obedience, as well as Ieſuits; and it is to bee ſuppoſed, that they obſerue them as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly. Beſides, they haue their continuall abſtinence, their diuerſe Lents, and many extraordinarie faſts, their nightly riſings and watchings to ſing laudes to God, to meditate and to pray, their great caſtigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and vſuall afflictions of their bodies; by diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plines, hard diet,, ſharpe attire, and other meanes of mortification. (All which the Ieſuits want, more than that now &amp; then like good ordinarie ſecular prieſts, they will be doing ſomething, but little to account of in reſpect of the continued toyles and mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of other holy religions men of all ſorts.) Now, if religious perfection were the cauſe of this fayned hatred or emnitie, we ſhould be moſt auerſed from all
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:1970:50"/>
theſe orders, in which we know theſe meanes of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, or perfections moſt to abound; and moſt loue and embrace the Ieſuits, in whom wee know all theſe to bee wanting. But neither be we enemies to thoſe holy orders, neither will thoſe holy men impute vnto vs this calumnie, neither can the Ieſuits them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues be ignorant, that we loue and honour thoſe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and men for their great vertues and mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of life. And therefore this ſlaunder is intollerable injurie vnto vs all, to make the world beleeue vs ſo void of grace and godlineſſe, that we are enemies to the Ieſuits for their vertue and perfection: thus put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vs in the ranke of the vileſt miſcreants that are, or can be imagined. The truth therefore is, that wee loue and honour the Ieſuits order, and ſhould both loue and honour them more, the more they and their order tendeth to perfection, and the lowlier conceit they caried of themſelues. And if we be their aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, it is for ſome other cauſe than their vertues.</p>

This is a comfort, that we may bee right good men before God and the world, notwithſtanding theſe Fathers account vs their aduerſaries, yea, and perſecute vs alſo, as they haue, and doe.

                  <p>I know that hee miſliked and condemned many things the Ieſuits did, and in this ſort hee was their aduerſarie, and ſo be we. For I haue heard him much condemne their gouernement of our colledge in Rome; namely, for their want of frugalitie, and vſing the houſes liuing to the moſt benefit of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for their palpable partialitie to ſome of the ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents aboue the reſt; for their continuall enticing and drawing by an hundred cunning means, our moſt towardly youths to be of their ſocietie: for keeping ſuch many times as they had allured and woon vnto them, vnder the names of our ſchollers, till they had ended their courſes of ſtudie; by which policie, the Ieſuits nouices occupied the roomes prouided for our ſtudents, and by them, more were entiſed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Ieſuits. Againe he condemned their gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in that for very trifles they would diſcontent and afflict the ſtudents, yea, and vpon light occaſions diſgrace them, diſmiſſe them before their time, and taking diſpleaſure, indaunger for a toy to breake and ouerthrow men of many good parts and expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. He was wont to ſay, that the gouernours of that Colledge, and their fellowes in England, had a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reſpect to their owne intereſt or benefite in both places, than to the common good of our country.</p>

Theſe miſlikes he had of their proceedings both in England and in Rome, made knowne vnto them by ſweet and friendly admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, cauſed them to account and report him to bee their aduerſarie.

                  <p>It was not ſo euill in either place then, as ſince his death it hath bene; but yet he perceiued well how in England the Ieſuits little tendred the good &amp; credit of our prieſts, and how that the more they had dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling among the ableſt ſort of Catholikes, the more decaied the maintenance of our ſeminarie at Doway or Rhemes, the cuſtomary almes not comming from England to it, as before there did when the ſecular prieſts had more doing. By reaſon of which want, that ſeminarie (the mother of all the reſt, and then much better to our nation than all the reſt, with it, are at this day) decayed euery yeare more and more in the Cardinals time. And for the Colledge at Rome, it was often in his time alſo in great tumult and gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boile, by reaſon of the contentions betweene the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits and ſchollers: which euer the gracious Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall pacified againe and ſuppreſſed, before it gaue ſcandale abroad, by his quiet, wiſe, and moderat dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with both parties. Yet haue I heard him much complaine of the Ieſuits headie and vndiſcreet go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement, and ſay their gouernment is naught, and they will neuer amend it, for they will not heare ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe: whileſt I liue, I ſhall keepe all downe, but after I be dead, yee ſhall ſee the ſchollers and them at wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full diſſentions.</p>

                  <p>It is not ſtrange, for it is vſuall in all eſtates, That the beſt men are not the beſt rulers.

The generall of the Ieſuits order that now liueth, was often wont to ſay to our Cardinall, that hee could haue ſtore of learned and vertuous men, but he found very few good gouernors among his ſubjects; which is a defect (as I ſaid) common to all orders and ſorts of people. Cardinall <hi>Allen</hi> would ſay that Fa. <hi>Creſwell</hi> the Ieſuit, &amp; once a turbulent Rector in the Engliſh Colledge at Rome, was a good man, and fit to be a ſubject, but the vnfitteſt to be a ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of any man that euer he had knowne: For (ſaid he) his delight was, to bee afflicting the ſchollers, and it was all one to bee an orderly or diſorderly man vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him; becauſe if they were externally vnruly, he would puniſh them, and if externally they obſerued their rules, he would yet be euer diſpleaſed, and vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, ſaying, That in their hearts they were ill diſpoſed, and that they conſpired againſt him to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue the rules in outward ſhew onely, to the intent he ſhould not giue them pennances.</p>

                  <p>Not ſurely for that hee either hated or diſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked any vertue in them, but becauſe they ſaw him to miſlike, condemne, and reſiſt their ordinarie diſorde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red proceedings in the gouernement of his ſemina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.

The Ieſuits will not denie, but that they haue aduerſaries in France, yea Catholicks,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:1970:53"/>
which concurred to their expulſion thence, and ſtill reſiſt their bringing in againe. VVhat? will they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme all the French nation, which bee their aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, the King, the Cardinals, the Biſhops, the inferior Cleargie, the Diuines, the Vniuerſities, the Nobilitie, the Gentrie, and all the people together, to be in Fa. <hi>Parſons</hi> graceleſſe predicament, and to be bad men? If they preſume thus farre, who will beleeue them? But before the generall baniſhments of the Ieſuits out of Fraunce, they euer accounted the Vniuerſitie of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris, and many Prelats and lay men, to haue been their aduerſaries or heauie friends, when there was no ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition of joyning againſt them with an hereticall or an euill prince. VVhat can they ſay to the Biſhops and Paſtours in the Low countries, and the Vniuerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Doway, whom they reckon to be their aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, by reaſon of the great contentions had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them about eight yeares ago?

                  <p>Surely not any perfection of vertue that is in them aboue other religious men, but their polliticke tampering, and their buſie ſtirring both in temporall ſtates, and Eccleſiaſticall. For they being not tied to keepe the quire with diuine offices, as other religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous orders bee, they haue more leiſure and libertie than any other, to occupie themſelues in matters impertinent vnto them. It is their glorie to bee euer ſtirring in the greateſt affaires, and with the greateſt perſonages where they come: yea, they delight ſo much in the actiue life, that their young men are no ſooner out of their nouiceſhip or courſe in learning, but if there be ought in them, they begin to tamper and to become polliticke, and muſt be thought ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to mannage any buſineſſe.

Againe, how by the Cardinals meanes they procured the diſplacing of ſome auncient officers about the king, and brought in ſuch as depended on themſelues, to no ſmall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contentment of many. And laſtly, how eſpecially vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Ieſuits motion and perſuaſion, the king enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the Affricane affaires, and reſolued to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take that fatall voyage, from which yet they could not afterwards diſſuade him, when it was miſliked and thought daungerous by all his friends,<note place="margin">This Historie is now in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh: See page <hi>9. 10. 11.</hi> &amp;c.</note> becauſe they had ſet him too farre in liking therwith before. But at the laſt, they wrought themſelues out of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:1970:54"/>
with the king as he ſayth, for they would ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rule all.</p>

which argueth him to bee a vertuous man: and by erecting Semenaries for the education of our yong men. And generally the Ieſuits ſeek not their owne temporall benefit, but beſtow themſelues onely for the good of others: &amp; many ſay, that without them our Church had bene in worſe caſe than it is. Againe, that it is but a ſlaunder, that they entermeddle in the mattets of you ſecular prieſts, or that they haue any dealings in the affaires of temporall eſtates. It is no juſt cauſe giuen you by them, but your own vnmor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified paſſions, and diſobedient minds to your lawfull ſuperiors, which make you to repine and mammer, and to exclaime againſt them.</p>

                  <p>For the Ieſuits in generall, I neuer ſaid nor thought other, but that if they keepe themſelues onely at theſe good exerciſes of preaching, of mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring ſacraments, without prejudice to the ordinarie Paſtors, of catechiſing, of teaching in ſchooles, of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiting the ſicke; and liuing as brethren and fellow la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers in Gods worke, ſeeke the eſtimation of the ſecular cleargie among their people: I neuer thoght (I ſay) but that they be very profitable coadjutors in Chriſts church, and deſerue loue and reuerence of all ſorts. But if withall they become officious ſticklers in princes affaires, Eccleſiaſticall or temporall, or buſie themſelues with entermedling in the ſecular Clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies matters, which belong not to them, and ſeeke to aduaunce themſelues in credit, and otherwiſe aboue the prieſts, as in England they haue done; I then thinke them very dangerous and noyſome members in any church, for the ſubuerſion of peace and good order; becauſe vpon that diſpoſition forthwith they bring in great deuiſions, and draw both prieſts and people into lamentable factions, as is manifeſt in this poore realme. At VVisbich you haue heard how they made very ſcandalous contentions about eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:1970:55"/>
a ſuperioritie in one of theirs, aboue all the other priſoners. You haue heard alſo how they hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the vnion of ſecular prieſts in a confraternitie: how they withſtood our endeuors touching Biſhops or Suffraganes: how without our conſents or priuitie they procured an Arch-prieſt to be ordained ouer all Engliſh prieſts in England and Scotland: they onely appointing what kind of ſuperioritie and gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment our Church ſhould haue, and chuſing the man which ſhould be ſuperior: notably abuſing his Hol. and our whole Cleargie in that action, and very cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly hereby preuenting, that no ſuperiour ſhould be ouer them within the realme. VVho but they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced the ſame authoritie, which themſelues onely had deuiſed, and fraudulently obtained?

VVho, after all was paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, renewed the ſame ſlaunder and infamie againſt the prieſts, that for charitie ſake had forgiuen it, but the Ieſuits in England and at Rome, and the Archp. by their aduiſe? VVho haue continued the ſtrife, by refuſing all conferences, friendly debatings, diſputes, meetings, and ſo many moſt reaſonable offers, and indifferent conditions of peace, and ending all, as we haue made? And who ſought to ouerbeare vs all by ſtrong hand, without reſpect of equitie and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but the Ieſuits, and the Archprieſt directed by them? VVho haue moſt vncharitably injuried our prieſts by ſuſpenſions, by depriuation of faculties, by in juſt decrees, by hereauing them of their mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, of their friends, and places of entertainement and harbour, and all this without triall or proofe of

any crime at all, or admitting them to anſwere, or ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them to appeare, but Ieſuits, abuſing the Archp. his authoritie? For by his inſtructions (as I haue ſaid before) he is to doe nothing without the Ieſuits ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe and direction in any matter of importance: the good men prouiding, that not onely they ſhould be exempted from all ſubjection and ſubordination to him and his authoritie; but alſo, that themſelues ſhould beare the greateſt ſtroke in the execution thereof. VVhat belonged all theſe matters to them, if they had been content to ſtand within their owne bounds? They are religious men, by their particular ſocietie and profeſſion, ſeperated from the ſecular cleargie, and making a diſtinct bodie of themſelues. By the rule of their order, not to take roomes of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacie among the Cleargie of the ſecular rank. VVhat then did it appertaine to them, to chuſe the manner of our gouernement, or to appoint who ſhould bee ſuperiour to vs?

They are prieſts and our fellow labourers, ſo be we to them alſo; this required at the moſt, that we might admit them to joyne with vs in aduiſe about

theſe elections, as wee did in all things; but it could neuer priuiledge them to enterpriſe and contriue theſe matters againſt our wils, or without our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents and priuitie; a great many of vs hauing labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the harueſt as much as they, others hauing toi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led farre aboue them, and as it were the whole bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and weight of the worke lying vpon our ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and not vpon theirs, eſpecially where painefull trauaile and pouertie is to be ſuſtained.

                  <p>I wiſh they did not, more than their equall ſhare. But it is noted that either all or the moſt great ſummes, come to the fingering of certaine lay men, moſt intirely deuoted, and familiar with the Ieſuits; the diſpoſition of which men is thought to be ſincere and iuſt, and not willing to diſperſe the almes but as the Ieſuits ſhall appoint or approoue. VVee know the Ieſuits to abound in all things; the Prieſts and poore Catholicks in many places, and the priſoners
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:1970:57"/>
generally to ſuffer penurie more than euer they did. Now, if wee had in our Church Biſhops or Suffra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganes, choſen by the free voyces of our Cleargie, can you thinke theſe ſummes ſhould be permitted thus vnprofitably to vaniſh away? or that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceutors ſhould not be brought to their accounts? or that the Ieſuites ſhould haue all the ſtroke in the diſtributions? or that their ſhares ſhould exceed the poore mens in ſo great inequalitie as a pound is to a pennie? There was neuer greater almes giuen, than hath beene within theſe foure or fiue yeeres, in which the Ieſuits haue borne the greateſt ſway: and yet there hath neuer beene the like wants a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong poore Catholicke prieſts, and amongſt poore Catholickes in priſon and abroad, and in the ſemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie at Doway as hath bene in theſe yeeres, and ſtill remaineth. It is wonderfull to conſider which way it goeth. The Ieſuits indeed abound in all things, but I will not charge them with bad dealing: let the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition plead thus, or ſo, as men conceiue of it.</p>

                  <p>Let this paſſe, and conſider by the premiſſes whether we haue not good cauſe to exclaime againſt the Ieſuits As for their report of our diſobedience, it is reproued before: and for our vnmortified paſſions, I will not much ſtand with them, but thinke that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ours nor theirs, are not ſo mortified I as could wiſh. Now by this which we haue alreadie ſaid, it is apparent ynough, that they haue but ouermuch dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in the affaires of our ſecular Cleargie: and for their entermedling in ſtate matters, it is needleſſe that any accuſe them, or go about to proue it, ſeeing their owne publicke actions giue aſſured teſtimonie againſt them. If they would denie it, Fa. <hi>P.</hi> owne han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die worke is extant; the booke of ſucceſſion, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in vnder the counterfeit name of <hi>Robert Doleman,</hi> hee rippeth vp the titles of all competitors to the crowne of England, diſgraceth and weakeneth in what hee may the claimes of ſome, extolleth and highly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunceth others, renuing the mortall diſſentions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the families of Yorke and Lancaſter, laying perillous grounds for moſt cruell workes and bloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhead in time to come, and drawing all to ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſon whome hee affecteth aboue the reſt. VVe will not ſpeake of his bitter and diſgracefull li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels againſt the deceaſed L.

as they were ſent into the realme, and yet in the Counſels hands for a teſtimony againſt him, touching inuaſions and ſolliciting of men by theſe vaine hopes to be in a readineſſe againſt his day, and I know not what daungerous follies beſides. But touch in few words ſome of his other actions, that you may ſee whether he deale in ſtate matters, or no. Did hee not earneſtly moue our young ſtudents in Spaine to ſet their hands to a ſchedule, that they would accept the Ladie <hi>Infanta</hi> for Queen of England, after the deceaſe of her Majeſtie that now is: yea, and finding them altogether vnwilling to intermeddle with thoſe grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt affaires, belonging nothing vnto them, and moſt hurtfull to both their cauſe and perſons; vſed he not this cunning ſhift to draw on the innocent and ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple youths, to pretend forſooth to them of Vallado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid, that the ſtudents in Seuill had done it already; no remedie then but they muſt follow: and hauing thus craftily gotten their names, hee ſhewed them to the ſtudents of Seuill, for an example of their fact and forwardneſſe, which he required them to imitate, that would bee well taken, that they all did thus ſhew themſelues deſirous of the L. <hi>Infanta</hi> for their Queen. Some more ſtout and better experienced than the reſt, withſtood the daungerous attempts, and would not yeeld: but they felt Fa. <hi>P.</hi> heauy hand vpon them euer after. VVas it not his vſuall perſuaſion to our ſtudents, when he would haue them to concurre with him in matters of ſtate, That by the laws of England they were alreadie traitors for their religion; then for tampering with him about any other the greateſt affaires, they could be no more. Goe to then, beeing once ouer ſhoes, be ouer boots alſo, ſtep in as farre as you can, and ſpare not. VVhen hee had printed his booke of Succeſſion, and was come to Rome, would hee not haue it publickely read in the Refectorie, at
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:1970:58"/>
ſuch times as the ſtudents minds cuſtomarily were fed with ſpirituall lectures? VVhich vaine-glorious and prophane deſire, when ſome of the ſchollers reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, becauſe they thought it very inconuenient and hurtfull vnto them, to be acquainted with his plots in princes titles and affaires: the good Fa. was excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding wroth with them, and they could neuer after haue his fauourable countenance. VVas it not Fa. <hi>Pa.</hi> and Fa. <hi>Creighton,</hi> Ieſuits, that with ſuch vehemencie &amp; bitterneſſe contended each againſt other in Spain about diſpoſing of the kingdome and crown of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Fa. <hi>Par.</hi> ſtriuing to bring all to the Ladie <hi>Infanta,</hi> and Fa. <hi>Creighton</hi> to his king of Scotland? in which controuerſie Fa. <hi>Parſons</hi> preuailed in that place, and fruſtrated and defeated all the deſires &amp; plots which his brother Ieſuit had laied in his ſuits. VVere they not Ieſuits which laied the plot with the late decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed duke of Parma, for ſurpriſing or ſtealing away the Ladie <hi>Arbella,</hi> and ſending her into Flaunders? VVho employed the meſſenger into England about that affaire, but Fa. <hi>Holt</hi> Ieſuit? VVho but the ſame Ieſuit was conſenting with Sir <hi>William Stanley</hi> to the ſending in of <hi>Richard Hesket,</hi> for ſolliciting <hi>Ferdinando,</hi> the late Earle of Darbie, to riſe againſt her Majeſtie, and to claime the crowne? VVas it not the ſame Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit that entertained <hi>Yorke</hi> and <hi>Yong</hi> in the plot of firing her Majeſties ſtore-houſes? That ſet on worke M. <hi>Francis Dickonſon</hi> and others, to perſuade watermen to flie with ſhips and all, into the ſeruice of the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard? VVho but Ieſuits feed the world dayly with freſh newes, &amp; expectation of warres &amp; alteration of the State by forrainers? But what, is this peculiar on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to our Engliſh Ieſuits, or haue not the Scottiſh fathers alſo in like manner beſtirred themſelues in that kingdome?

Theſe politicke courſes, and this buſie and dangerous en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termedling by the Scottiſh Ieſuits in Scotland, grew odious euen to the beſt there, and ruinated thereby the good eſtates of many, without hope of reaping benefit in any time to come. And yet forſooth the Ieſuits are falſly ſlaundered, when they are ſayd to deale in ſtate matters. I know there be ſome of them which miſlike theſe courſes, and either through their owne vertuous diſpoſition, or for reſpect of their owne quiet, ſafetie, or diſabilitie, or finally for their ſtudie or a religious life, ſhun in what they can al this kind of profane intermedling: yet the vertuous and temperat demeanour of theſe, can no more juſtifie nor excuſe the dangerous ſtickling of their fellowes, than the preſumptions of theſe buſie heads can ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh or deface their vertuous and religious cariage. Neyther haue I rehearſed thus much for any other end than to let you know how that the report is to be verefied of them, and not of vs ſecular prieſts: and how vnder the profeſsion of Ieſuits, all be not morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:1970:59"/>
but ſome haue very politicke and ſtirring heads, yea in the waightieſt matters that are. And for Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Pa ſons,</hi> that he more beats his brains about ſtate matters than about the exerciſe of a religious life, it is euident by this one thing I will now tell you, beſides all I haue ſayd before or may juſtly bee ſayd of him. VVhiles he was in Spaine, you ſee how he toſſed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the Titles and Claims to the crowne of England; but beſides this, he wrot two books of the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all the ſtates of England. There the deuout Ieſuit ſetteth vpon the Court. To rule in it hee ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth orders for reformation of the prince and cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, and appointeth what they ſhall obſerue in their gouernment and liuing. The court of Parliament he will haue brought to better forme. Then preſcribeth he reformations to the Biſhops, prelats, and paſtors: they muſt away with pompe and ſuperfluities, and be put to their penſions: there he ſetteth downe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruances to all the ſecular ſtates, and taketh vpon him to reforme the Counſellors, Noblemen, the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, Yeomanrie and all. Then he cenſureth the Law, and appointeth what reformations are to bee made in it, and in the Lawyers. He commeth to the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſities and Colledges, and in them hee will haue ſtrange Metamorphoſes. He dealeth with Cities al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo and Corporations, Townes, Villages, Artiſans eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape not the Cenſurers rod. No religious orders muſt be admitted within the realme, except Ieſuits and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſed Carthuſians. No Abbey lands muſt be reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, except that of S. <hi>Ihones</hi> for erecting Colledges and houſes for the Ieſuits. This and much more ſtirre he maketh, as diuers haue told me, tampering in all eſtates; and yet Fa. <hi>Par.</hi> and Ieſuits entermeddle not with prophane matters of eſtate.</p>

                  <p>They haue as ſharpe lawes in this point as we; but thus the wiſe Ieſuits preuented all dangers: They freely permitted Catholickes to goe to church with proteſtants, and made no ſinne nor ſcruple of this as we doe.

                  <p>In this ſort they did it: If one were a notorious knowne Catholicke where hee came, then they taught it to bee vnlawfull in that place to goe to church, by reaſon of ſcandale, and no otherwiſe. But if one were not certainely knowne to bee ſuch a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke, he might goe without offence; vpon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that if he heard any hereticall doctrine prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, which mooued him to doubt in any point of faith, he ſhould preſently come to ſome of thoſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to be reſolued.</p>

                  <p>All theſe auncient and wife Fathers agreed vpon it, and practiſed as I haue told you.

                  <p>But our Engliſh Ieſuits euer practiſed and taught the contrary to thoſe Scottiſh Ieſuits.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Pr.</speaker>
                  <p>They haue done ſo, for any thing that euer I heard to the contrarie, except once, that Fa. <hi>Boſgraue</hi> went to church, and Fa. <hi>Thomas Langdale,</hi> and as ſome ſay, Fa. <hi>Kirkham,</hi> which fell farther tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to go to church with proteſtants. The Engliſh Ieſuits found our ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar prieſts to haue rightly inſtructed and reformed our church in this point, and to haue eſtabliſhed both the doctrine and the practiſe before their entrance;
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:1970:61"/>
and therefore they could not without great confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and diſcredit runne any other courſe than that wherein they ſaw our prieſts to haue led them the way. Marry, what they would haue done in this caſe, if they had firſt ſet vpon the worke, and begun in England a forme and practiſe of religion before ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar prieſts, as their bretheren Ieſuits did in Scotland; this I cannot certainely diuine: but I doubt mee greatly, both by the proceedings of thoſe auncient and learned Scottiſh Ieſuits, and by the pleaſing hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of their fellowes here, they would not haue beene ſo ſtrict in the matter, as both they and we bee now, refuſing with ſo great detriment of goods, lands, libertie, and liues, the leaſt participation or reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of communion with proteſtants, in all points, practiſe, and profeſſion of religion. For I know a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Ieſuit now in England, who, I heare hath made offer of a ſcandalous, and in my conceit a very vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull libertie: If that a Gentleman will become Catholicke, hee ſhould haue licence to eat fleſh in Lent, and in all faſting dayes, among Lollards and Proteſtants; that by ſo doing, hee might liue without ſuſpition of being a Catholicke, and eſcape daunger of the lawes.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Gent.</speaker>
                  <p>This were a prettie licence, and not much vnlike to that you rehearſed of theirs in Scotland. And if this were permitted, we ſhould haue ſoone a fine peece of iuggling in the exerciſe of our religion. In my opinion, the Catholike that ſhould eate fleſh vpon faſting dayes with proteſtants, thereby to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them to thinke him no Catholick, but agreeing with them in that point of religious obſeruancie, ſhould commit a greeuous mortall ſinne, by inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to ſeeme no Catholicke, but a Lollard, or prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant. And this, albeit hee had another principall end of his action, as to keepe himſelfe thereby from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciphering
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:1970:62"/>
what he were, and from many temporall loſſes: For this ſeemeth to bee an ill meane to thoſe lawfull ends, and (as you ſaid before) we muſt not do ill that good may come vpon it. Beſides, in this caſe mee thinkes a Catholicke man ſhould bee bound to profeſſe his faith and religion, by abſtinence from fleſh among thoſe proteſtants, they breaking the faſt in contempt of Chriſts religion and church. In which end or action, a Catholicke ſhould not any way par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate with them, neither formally nor materially, when it cannot bee done without prejudice to the faith, nor without ſcandale, as here it hardly can: eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially the proteſtants owne law commaunding the due obſeruance of ſuch faſts. And truly, admit in this caſe a Catholicke man were not bound to profeſſe his religion by abſtinence, eſpecially, if there by ſome great loſſe or harme ſhould certainely befall him: yet I perceiue no reaſon, why hee may by any act of his, bearing a ſhew to be oppoſite to his religion and the precept of Gods church, make any externall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance of an hereticall profeſſion, as hee doth by eating with them.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Pr.</speaker>
                  <p>Theſe reaſons of yours haue perhaps better grounds to vphold them, than the Ieſuites libertie hath: and without peraduenture it is the ſurer way for any Catholicke to take. It is the opinion of all the learned, that no man ought to doe any thing, either ſcandalous or prejudiciall to the faith of the church, for to ſaue himſelfe thereby from a temporall harme. Now this eating of fleſh, beeing alwayes (morally ſpeaking) ſcandalous and prejudiciall to Catholicke religion in our countrey: it cannot bee juſtified by this circumſtance or end, to wit, that thereby a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke ſhall not be noted to bee a Catholicke. For if a Catholick ſhould eat to be thought a proteſtant, his eating were damnable; ſeeing that to bee noted
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:1970:62"/>
to bee a Catholicke, is in it ſelfe no temporall harme to any: and the temporall detriments and loſſes which may enſue to any by this diſcouerie or note, may be either preuented before they fall, or they bee no more but ordinarie in theſe times of perſecution, and ought to be borne of euery Catholicke with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, rather than to bee ſhunned with ſcandale, or the leaſt diſhonour to God and his Church that may be deuiſed. And in theſe matters of action, and in the exerciſe of religious obſeruandes, it is not fit to take or teach a faſhion, lying ſo neare to daungerous ſinne (if it be not ſinne of it ſelfe) as doth this eating of fleſh with proteſtants.</p>

                  <p>I thinke no leſſe. I haue alſo heard, that the Ieſuits haue graunted ſome extraordinarie liberties lately, about conferences had by Catholicke priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners with Proteſtants, for procuring their libertie thereby: alſo about licenſing or holding opinion, That a Catholicke may lawfully marrie with an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticke.</p>

                  <p>I haue heard no certainetie of this matter. But let theſe be as they ſhall, our Engliſh Church is happie by the courſe of our ſecular prieſts, and theirs of Scotland is in bad tearmes, by the courſes of the Ieſuits. Now, where you ſaid, That our Church would not haue been in ſo good caſe as it is, but for the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits: I am not to judge hereof. For on the one ſide, no doubt but they haue done good; becauſe it is not to be thought, that ſo many of them as are in the realme, haue been idle and fruitleſſe, but haue helped forward Gods worke; though not to bee compared with the ſecular prieſts in this point: no, not ſetting man for man. For the great toile and burden of the worke hath euer lien vpon ſecular prieſts; and thoſe cheefely which laboured among the poore, not able to releeue them with meat or money, or any other
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:1970:63"/>
ordinarie ſupplie of neceſſarie apparrell or conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent lodging, ſome of them ſuffering more miſerie in one quarter of a yeare for gaining poore ſoules, than all the Ieſuits in England doe in a whole yeare; who commonly keepe richeſt houſes, and ſuſtain no want of things neceſſarie or conuenient. And on the other ſide, they haue cauſed by their cunning plots and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie tampering, ſo great deuiſion among the prieſts themſelues, and raiſed ſo horrible diſſention and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlike of both prieſts and people, one with another; which was neuer heard of in our nation, before they began their politicke ſtirrings and brokings of facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and finally, ſo greeuouſly deminiſhed the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, eſtimation, and reuerence of prieſts, due vnto them from the laitie, yea, brought them into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, that I feare mee much all the good they haue done by their ſpirituall labours, will not counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile the harmes they haue wrought by theſe polli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke and ſtrange endeuours of theirs. For it was better without compariſon to haue our Church, Prieſts, and People vnited together in great loue and reuerence, both ſincere, ſimple, deuout, and in peace, as it was before many of the Ieſuits entered; than to haue among vs emulations, contentions, pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licies, contempt of prieſts, falſhoods in fellowſhip, a diſtruſt or a feare each of other, ſlaunders, infamies, and a generall decay of vertue and deuotion, as now the matter is brought vnto, and had neuer ben like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to haue entered, if they had not come amongſt vs. And ſure I am, that the cheefe nourſey of our church, that is, the Seminarie of Doway, is exceedingly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caied, ſince the Ieſuits had the mannaging of things, eſpecially of the almes purſe in England. And for the Seminarie alſo in Rome, no man can reprooue vs of an vntruth, if wee ſay that it in like ſort hath ſuffered no ſmall detriment, ſince the death of

                  <p>It is a vain glorious boaſt, and a fiction.

                  <p>Marry, many thinke it ſtrange you ſhould be at diſſention with him, hee beeing a man ſo well thought of and eſteemed both in his owne order and by the moſt that know him: his booke of Reſolution argueth him to be a holy man, and his endeuours in erecting Seminaries for our countrey, ſheweth, that he is both a good man, and moſt carefull for the good of our countrey, and to bee far from doing any of you wrong in the leaſt thing that may be, &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>If Fa. <hi>Parſons</hi> haue deepely wronged vs, men need not to wonder, that there ſhould bee contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons betweene him and vs. It is no whit likely that we ſhould ſtomacke the man, or contend with him, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe he had giuen vs cauſe. VVee will therefore diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſe this point, and touch all the reſt which you haue mentioned for his commendation: but let vs take them in order as you ſpoke them. For the credit and eſtimation he hath among men of his owne order; it is with ſome of them good, and with others very meane; and they all generally repute him to be very polliticke, and of a buſie and ſtirring diſpoſition, more deſirous in all things to draw all men to his owne will, yea, and violently to enforce thereto ſuch as be weaker, than hee is to follow any other mans
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:1970:64"/>
aduiſe or courſe. I know ſome Ieſuits his ſeniors in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, men of better talent than he, who looking in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his peremptorie and headie courſes, haue often cenſured thus vpon him: That he was too contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and wilfull, and that it were better for their reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and the world alſo, that hee were ſhut vp for euer in ſome religious houſe, than to bee ſtickling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, and tampering in all matters as hee dooth, which muſt of neceſſitie in the end turne to the harme of many, and to the diſcredit of their ſociety, after his deuiſes come to light. Alſo I haue credibly heard, that others ſhould often complaine and ſay of him, That their ſocietie was more troubled and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted, yea, and diſcredited, by the deuiſes and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie of one Engliſhman, Father <hi>Parſons,</hi> than by all the men of other countries beſides: for hee neuer ceaſeth wrangling and contending with one or other, and with many at once. I haue my ſelfe heard a Scottiſh Ieſuit (farre his auncient in the ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie, &amp; of a good account) to inveigh greatly againſt Father <hi>Parſons</hi> violent nature and courſes, and to condemne his polliticke and cunning entermedling in all matters, to the hurt of many, and to the diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of their order. Father <hi>Holts</hi> and Fa. <hi>Hawoods</hi> opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of him was (theſe Ieſuits I name, becauſe they be dead) that he was of a violent and imperious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition in moſt things, and with the moſt men hee dealt with; neuer quiet, vnleſſe hee ouer-ruled all; exquiſit cunning, with flatterie and fawning to bring others to his bend, and if this would not win them, then to be moſt fierce and violent, vtterly to breake them that ſhould ſtand in his way. The religious Fa. hath found many occaſions, and deuiſed many ſhifts theſe twentie yeares and more, that hee might liue abroad out of his order, and be employed to ſollicite affaires in princes courts, or to haue rule and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:1970:64"/>
in Colledges. And the conceit he carrieth of his owne wit and ſufficiencie, maketh him to attempt any thing, and euer to bee vnwilling to condeſcend to any mans aduiſe but his owne. The men of his owne ſocietie alſo note this in him, That hee hath a ſpeciall regard to haue the whole managing of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh affaires, and that no other of his bretheren, how auncient, wiſe, or learned ſoeuer, ſhall communicat with him in theſe matters, or haue any dealing, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe they yeeld themſelues in euery point to follow his directions and courſes, and be wholly at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement. And they ſay this only to be the cauſe why he hath hindered all the graueſt and moſt ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Engliſh Ieſuits beyond the ſeas to come into the realme, or to entermeddle in the wielding of our Churches affaires; leaſt (forſooth) they ſhould refuſe to follow his deuiſes, and by a more diſcreet and temperate courſe, both win from him the credit, and beare away the principal ſtroke and commaund. Thus much for the eſtimation he hath among many good men of his owne ſocietie.</p>

claime from before two hundred yeares, and ſo handle the matter with a cunning flouriſh, that it muſt bee made to ſeeme the beſt and likelieſt of all that haue been ſince. For not onely hee aduaunceth the ſurmiſed Spaniſh Title, but diſgraceth in what he may, and weakeneth all the reſt. This his plotting about the crowne and kingdome of England, and ſharing it to the Ladie <hi>Infanta,</hi> with deuiſing proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble meanes (as he perſuadeth them) to effect his plot, made him very famous and highly eſteemed in that nation, and woon to him ſuch ſingular grace of the old King, the Ladie <hi>Infanta,</hi> and all their friends, that his word might doe much in any matter, either to pleaſure his friend or diſpleaſure his aduerſary. Hence alſo doth proceed the fauour and credit he hath with the Embaſſadour of Spaine, and all them of the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh faction in Rome: the hope wherewith he dayly feedeth them of bringing this to paſſe by his owne pollicies, and the helpes he can procure in England, cauſeth them to admire the man, and him to be moſt highly eſteemed among them.</p>

                  <p>As this booke of Reſolution was a good work, and woon him all the credit which was due to <hi>Grana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,</hi> that laid the platforme to Father <hi>Parſons</hi> hand, and gaue him the principall grounds and matter there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and which alſo was deſerued by maiſter <hi>Brinckley</hi> for the penning (as diuers report:) ſo no doubt the libell he writ againſt the Earle of Leiceſter, and the other againſt the old L. Treaſurer, and this worke of Succeſſion, whereby he entitleth the Ladie <hi>Infanta</hi> to the crowne of England, with diſgracing all other Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles and Competitors, hath got him much hatred and diſcredit in England and Scotland. If the booke were his, it was well done, and he deſerued commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for it; and ſurely, if he had gone forward with the other two parts (as he promiſed) hee had ſpent theſe twentie yeares and moe, both more to Gods honour and the good of his countrey, and to his own greater merit, than he hath done by all his other pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticke ſtickling in matters of State, or by his cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, his violent, his contentious, and his vnconſcio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable proceedings otherwiſe. But his head was too buſie, and ouermuch prophaned; and greatly it is to be feared, (his dealing conſidered in Spaine and in Rome alſo, againſt our ſtudents, and the two good prieſts we ſent thether about this authoritie: again, his deceiuing the Pope by falſe information, both in procuring the authoritie, &amp; by incenſing him againſt the prieſts) that when he finiſhed that booke of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:1970:66"/>
he made an end alſo therewith of deuotion, ſinceritie, and honeſt dealing. It is no certaine nor probable argument to proue a man to be a Saint, or a vertuous and a good man, becauſe in times paſt he hath written a vertuous booke; yea, or becauſe hee writeth one in the preſent. For this abilitie conſiſteth principally in the power of a mans vnderſtanding: whereas vertue and goodneſſe, as well ſupernaturall as naturall, reſteth in the will, and affecteth the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations thereof. <hi>Lucifer</hi> that damned fiend was a Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubin of higheſt intelligence, hee and his wicked an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels exceed all men in wit and knowledge, and want no skill to contriue and make ſpirituall bookes of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute perfection: yet this great knowledge of theirs neithet maketh them good, nor can argue them to be vertuous ſpirits, as long as their will is peruerted. The like we may ſay of <hi>Adam,</hi> that neither his great graces wherein he was created, nor his ſupernaturall gifts, which remain after his fall, (in both which ſtates he had ſufficient skill to deliuer to the world as good doctrine, as Fa. <hi>Parſon</hi> hath done) could proue him to be a good man, when he had caſt himſelfe out of the ſtate of grace, into ſinne: and the fame is true alſo in euery learned man, beeing in mortall ſinne; and in Fa. <hi>Parſon</hi> himſelfe, if at any time ſince he hath beene in that damnable ſtate: by their ſinne they are depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of juſtifying grace, and other ſupernaturall ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues depending therupon; but their faith, their hope, and knowledge gotten before their fall, remaineth ſtill; by which they may teach and write as perfect doctrine as before they could. Yea, I haue heard Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor <hi>Stapleton</hi> report of certaine bookes written vpon the holy Scripture by <hi>Iohn Caluin,</hi> that they contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned excellent good morall doctrine; and if the here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies entermingled therewith, were cancelled, that they might be read with great profite and pleaſure;
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:1970:66"/>
and yet no Catholicke will denie, but that <hi>Caluine</hi> notwithſtanding all this, was a great enemie to the Romane religion. Did not <hi>Salomon</hi> write many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine volumnes, and yet afterwards he became a bad man? Now let Fa. <hi>Parſons</hi> booke goe with that deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued commendations: what hee was, good or bad, whiles hee writ it (for hee might bee either) I cannot judge, and I will ſuppoſe the beſt; but what hee hath been ſince, his owne bad actions yeeld preſumptions ouer-pregnant and probable, that ſometimes he hath been no Saint, nor ſincere honeſt man.</p>

                  <p>In my conceit, it is a manifeſt ſigne of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in wiſedome, judgement, and diſcretion, for any ſo worthely to valew a man for one or many his good actions paſt, that when after the ſame he doeth euill, he will not beleeue, or ſee it; or elſe in manifeſt faults ſtand to juſtifie and defend him, by reaſon hee was once a good man, or had done well before. For mens judgements ſhould be conformable to the object, or otherwayes they cannot be true: and in this, though the precede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t good actions ought to ſtay a man from raſh judgement, and to make euery one ſuſpend his cenſure vntill he be aſſured of the fact; yet when his euill doing is once apparant, a wiſe man ſhould not let his affection cary him away to judge blacke to be white, or a man fall'n to vice, to remaine ſtill a ſaint.</p>

                  <p>If men would judicially conſider what he hath done in this point, perhaps they would thinke worſe of him and his actions than they doe. For albeit there be now by his meanes moe Semenaries for our yong ſtudients, than before; yet doubleſſe our Countrey reapeth much leſſe benefit now by all, than it did of old, by the two onely of Rome and Doway. So that in trueth his endeauours in erecting new Colledges or Seminaries, haue rather much diminiſhed the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie, and decayed the good of our Countrey, than encreaſed it: and then conſequently Fa. <hi>P.</hi> deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth ſmall thanks for his labour.</p>

                  <p>Marry, before Fa, <hi>Par.</hi> erected his, and before the Ieſuits had the greateſt ſtroke in monie matters in England, it is well knowne that in the Colledge at Rhemes, there were ſometimes eight ſcore, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whiles 200, or 220. of our Countrie-men, old and yong, ſtudents; now the number is diminiſhed to 60. All that came were well-come, and friendly enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, none rejected, brought they money, or brought they none: now can none bee receiued without a groſſe ſumme of monie, or elſe a yeare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtipend, vnleſſe he be fit at the firſt to ſtudie Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie;

and either not at all, or very hardly can any be entertained, vnleſſe he be ſent or commended by the Ieſuits, and Archp-rieſt: In thoſe dayes ſixteene prieſts or moe were ſent into England in one yeere, now three, or foure bee many: then the renowned fame, and glory of the Colledge, drew vnto it good ſchollers, and ancient men, from the Vniuerſities of Oxford, and Cambridge; but now it hath loſt the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient credit, and thought a meeter ſchoole for boyes, than for men: then, it was a famous Nurſerie for the beſt Literature; now the ſcience of ſcholaſticall Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinitie, is not much reſpected, if it be not altogether laid aſide.

England, the poore prieſts and Catholicks neuer ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered ſuch great want of releefe, as they haue done theſe late years; the Ieſuits indeed haue abundance, but ſo great ſummes cannot be conſumed vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  <p>It is better ſo than worſe. But marke now what dammage enſueth thereby to our Church. The Colledge of S.

Now the Colledge of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way or Rhemes, entertained indifferently all that came, and vpon the vſuall almes ſent from England, maintained them, albeit they brought nothing: but if this Colledge at S. Omers for children that come alſo well prouided, intercept or receiue the almes which were accuſtomed to bee ſent to Doway or Rhemes, for the maintenance not of as many chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren onely, but alſo of at the leaſt foure times as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny prieſts as be there now, is it not manifeſt, that our countrey looſeth far more at Doway, than it gaineth at S.

                  <p>It may be, that this notable defect is ſupplied

                  <p>I perceiue not that it is ſo.

VVhen Doctor <hi>Barret,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident of the Colledge at Rhemes, perceiued this hurtfull effect to befall our countrey, by Fa. <hi>Parſons</hi> diligence in erecting theſe new Colledges, hee writ ſeriouſly to him about the matter, and aſſured him, That it was much better to maintaine the Colledge of Rhemes, which was the beginner of all our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries happineſſe, next to God, and was the greateſt glorie and good of our Nation, than to build new ones to the decay of this: but Fa. <hi>Parſons</hi> (after his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion, impatient of any admonition) tooke his aduiſe in very ill part; and to correct the Preſidents bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, forſlowed (as was thought) to procure the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh penſion, till the Colledge was almoſt vndone, and diſſolued.</p>

<pb n="114" facs="tcp:1970:69"/>
by the Ieſuits, and which was euer auoided at Rhemes &amp; Doway, gouerned by our ſecular prieſts; we haue good cauſe to thinke our countrey to gaine nothing by theſe new Colledges for continully they entice and allure many of our fineſt wits, and moſt towardly youth from the ordinarie vocation of our Cleargie and of our ſecular Paſtours, to bee of their own ſocietie. Many alſo they make (for trifles) male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents, by their polliticke dealing; they driue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers from their naturall ſimplicitie, to become cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning headed; not a few they diſmiſſe the finiſhing of their ſtudies, vpon light diſcontentments; many they quite breake by indiſcreet wrongs and incompaſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate handling: and finally, thoſe Colledges are the principall fountaines of contentions and deuiſions among our Cleargie; ſome in matters of ſtrife ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with the Ieſuits, and ſome againſt them, as now you ſee in England; which breaches of peace and concord were neuer among the prieſts brought vp at Rhemes or Doway, before the Ieſuits and their diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples entred the realme, and made factions againſt ſuch as had contended with them in their Colledges, or liſted not to run their courſes, and feed their hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors in England. Now for the Colledge in Rome, how they haue vſed the matter, I know not; but eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſecond or third yeare ſince it was founded, there haue beene monſtrous contentions and tumults be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the ſtudents and them, to the vnſpeakeable dammage of our Church.

they ſay that Doway alſo is wholly at Fa. <hi>Parſons</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion and direction in euery thing, eſpecially ſince he placed Doctor <hi>Worthington</hi> to bee Preſident there, who is a man known to be the Ieſuits entireſt depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant:) it muſt follow hereupon, that they ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force all the Catholickes in England to ſeeke vnto them to win their fauours, to pretend at leaſt to bee their friends, to depend wholly vpon them, and to run their courſes; for otherwiſe their children ſhall be debarred of all benefit that may bee had in thoſe Seminaries.

                  <p>For their earneſt and diligent fiſhing, it is very true, they doe it moſt carefully, and they vſe the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, as a cheefe meane to catch the ſchollers; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides mine owne certaine knowledge and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of their great and dayly induſtrie in this point, I haue knowne ſome of their owne ſociety much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn them for it. Fa. <hi>Holt</hi> himſelfe hath told me, that their ſocietie delighted much in this fiſhing; and to be moſt impatient of reproofe or oppoſition therin: But of our Engliſh Ieſuits, eſpecially Fa. <hi>Parſons</hi> and Fa. <hi>Creſwell</hi> are moſt zealous in this point.

He ſaid moreouer, That this fiſhing, with the partialitie they vſed to them, (they either had catched, or deſired to allure) was the principall root of diſcontentments and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions betweene them and the Ieſuits in the Semina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.

Now for the diſpoſition of our countrymen which vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take that courſe of life, it is well knowne, that before they come vnder the Ieſuits gouernement, they be generally of the moſt vertuous &amp; towardlieſt youths our nation yeeldeth; neuer noted for drunkards, or enormiouſly diſordered and diſſolute, eſpecially in thoſe vices, whereunto other countries wherein they liue, are moſt ſubject.

                  <p>There be many great preſumptions of the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits vncharitable and bad dealing in that action. For the ſtudents were exceedingly pinched in their diet, ſome thought, vpon purpoſe to cauſe them to ſeeke for more abroad. Againe, Fa. <hi>Parſons</hi> admitted a mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Iriſhman into the Colledge, and put him in the habit of a ſtudent; he could ſcarſe ſay his <hi>Pater noſter,</hi> yet that fauour hee found, for what purpoſe God knowes. This married Iriſhman earneſtly ſollicited now theſe, now others, of the ſtudents, to goe with him to the cookes houſe to breake their faſts. Some perceiuing diuers to be drawne by this mans entice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and fearing the Ieſuits conniuence and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in the matter (for they could not but know its admit they ſet not the Iriſhman aworke, as many greatly feared they did) would turne the ſtudents to ſome greater harme in the end; they themſelues ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh Fa. <hi>Parſons</hi> and the reſt, of the diſorder, and deſired them to be more carefull, and to preuent the inconueniences which might enſue to the Colledge thereby: yea, and further told them, that their neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence in the matter, yeelded no ſmall ſuſpition of ſome further aduauntage and drift they intended a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſtudents. The good Fathers ſeemed not to beleeue, nor much to regard the thing. At the laſt, this Iriſhman with great importunitie inticed one of the prieſts to goe with him. This prieſt was a good vertuous man, of good example and edification to all the reſt, and had been with his fellowes oppoſit to the Ieſuits in all contentions with them: after the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe of Cardinall <hi>Allen,</hi> his innocencie and vertuous behauiour bare him out, that the Ieſuits could haue nothing to except againſt him in all thoſe tumults. After he, the Iriſhman, and another prieſt, had cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated abroad, in their returne home they went to an Engliſh prieſts chamber in the citie, called Maſter
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:1970:75"/>
                     <hi>Midleton,</hi> who had had much bickering with Fa. <hi>Parſons</hi> both in Spaine and Rome. In his chamber they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to breake their faſt, but the Iriſhman would haue them in any caſe to take it in the cookes houſe, which was at the next dore, and at the laſt he preuai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led: they had no ſooner entered, and called for ſome meat, but before they had taſted, behold the Isbeces or ſouldiors come vpon them, and apprehend them; a ſtrange thing in that towne, and the like not heard of before. Fa. <hi>Parſons</hi> was ſent for, hee ſeeming vnac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the ſtratagem, lamented their misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and in the way of fauour procured they ſhould be impriſoned in the Colledge. He ſhut vp euery one apart in cloſe priſon. The Iriſhman ſeeing his procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, exclaimed againſt him, but he was charily kept and could neuer after bee ſpoken with by the ſchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, leaſt he ſhould tell tales. Then began Fa. <hi>Parſons</hi> and the Ieſuits to beſtirre them, and cauſed all the ſtudents to come each one before his friend <hi>Accriſio</hi> the Fiſcall, and himſelfe, and to confeſſe how often they had been at the cookes houſe, or eaten abroad; and he aſſured them, that they were bound in conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence euery one to accuſe himſelfe. He was the exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, his Ieſuits the notaries, and when hee had gotten this aduauntage againſt the yong men, he diuulged what pleaſed himſelfe; hee incenſed the Pope, the Cardinals, and all the citie againſt them, &amp; wrought the vtter diſcredit of our countreymen, which before that day were honoured and highly eſteemed of (not without great cauſe) in that towne, and all the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian world beſides. Then brought hee in the orders, which the Ieſuits had ſo much deſired: hee diſmiſſed diuers of the diſgraced prieſts into England with or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie faculties, and with friendſhip (as then he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended) but recalled their faculties before they arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in Flaunders, and ſent infamous libels againſt
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:1970:75"/>
them vnto his Ieſuits in England, containing moſt vile crimes; whereof (as the prieſts proteſt vpon their ſaluation) they were altogether innocent, and not ſo much as once examined of, whiles they were in Rome. The prieſts at their departure, fearing that Fa. <hi>Parſons</hi> bad dealing would haue no end nor meaſure, beſought him to let their faults bee knowne in their preſence, leaſt that after they were gone, other things might be laid vnto them than they had either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed or done. This he would not graunt, but willed them to depart in peace, and to aſſure themſelues, that he had no great matter againſt them, except that diſorder of eating abroad: the greateſt offenders were left behind; yet after theſe were once gone, he cleared the reſt of the greateſt crimes, and ſaid they touched onely them that were departed. Thus this good Father jugled, and wrought the ſhame and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit of our good countreymen among ſtrangers, and proſecuted the vtter ſubuerſion of their good names in England by his infamous libels.</p>

                  <p>Theſe be wofull things to heare: but I, and others haue noted one wonderfull worke of Gods in this caſe, (that is) That many of theſe young prieſts ſo diſgraced by Fa. <hi>Parſon</hi> and the Ieſuits, haue fall'n ſince their comming into England into the hands of our common enemies, yet they all haue ſtood conſtantly to their profeſſion, and indured pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently both priſons, and what elſe hath beene done againſt them: VVhich vertuous carriage could not haue proceeded from them, if they had been men of that diſſolute diſpoſition, as Fa. <hi>Parſon,</hi> and the Ieſuits would make vs beleeue.</p>

                  <p>Thus they ſlander vs throughout the realme, and theſe be Fa. <hi>P.</hi> words alſo in his letters to his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociats in England, the 18. of Ianuarie 1599. vnder the name of <hi>Martine Aray,</hi> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had the two prieſts we ſent to his Ho. faſt in priſon. But to refute the malicious ſlaunder, we need do no more but appeale to his, and his aſſociats owne conſciences, and to the indifferent iudgements of all honeſt men. For firſt, it is ſo certaine and manifeſt, that Fa. <hi>P.</hi> with diuers of his brethren haue dealt in the greateſt matters of State that may be, concerning both the preſent al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration of all, and the future diſpoſition of the crown and kingdome; that with any ſhew of truth or hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, it cannot be denied: and yet neither hee nor all his adherents ſhall be euer able to proue, or truly to affirme, that thoſe two prieſts, Maſter Doctor <hi>Biſhop,</hi> and M. <hi>Charnock,</hi> or any of vs (whome ſo vehemently they ſeeke to ouerthrow in our good names by their manifold vntrue ſlaunders, and by this ſhameleſſe letter of his to bring vs in hatred with all Catholicks in the world, and to ſtir vp againſt vs our own prince and magiſtrats to bereaue vs of our liues) he ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be able to proue, that we haue dealt in State mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, or liked of his dealings. It hath pleaſed him and his fellows preſumptuouſly to tamper in theſe affairs,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:1970:76"/>
which concerned them not. They haue ſet vp their reſt vpon the hopes of Spaine, procured the emnitie of the king of Scots, and of all other competitors to the crowne of England. Now of likelyhood, Fa. <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> is ſorrie we be not ouer boots with him, and fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the euent, he waxeth jealous of all mens acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and ſpecially of ours, whom he knoweth to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne his daungerous and harmefull courſes; and the zealous father finding vs not to run with him as he would haue vs for Spaine, or the Ladie <hi>Infanta,</hi> (as truly it becommeth not vs to meddle in theſe great affaires, but to applie our function, and to commit the diſpoſing of kingdomes and princes buſineſſes to Gods wiſdome and prouidence, ſeeing our intermed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in them may bee offenſiue and hurtfull many wayes both to our ſelues and our Catholick people, without any profit at all) he imagineth that we be his aduerſaries, and conſequently to fauour the king of Scots, whom he hath needleſſely made his enemie: which king of Scots hee affirmeth (for our greater diſgrace with all Catholickes) to be a knowne here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke, and vs to bee Scotiſts in faction; a thing moſt offenſiue to our preſent ſtate, as he ſaith. In which vncharitable calumnies, how Fa. <hi>Parſons</hi> can acquit himſelfe of too bad dealing, both with the preſent State, and vs, it goeth beyond my capacitie to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand. For how knoweth he that it offendeth the preſent State, her Majeſtie, her honorable Councell, and other magiſtrats, that any ſhould affect the king of Scots, and preferre him before all others after her Majeſties deceaſe. The preſent State maketh no ſhew at all of any ſuch auerſion from the king of Scots and his title. Fa. <hi>Parſons</hi> then vpon his own ſurmiſe ſhould not affirme ſo odious a thing. VVhich if it bee true, and ſo conceiued vpon his aſſertion, it may very well
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:1970:77"/>
be matter of diſguſt and quarrell betweene her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie and that king, and perhaps touch the preſent State, with diſſimulation of kindneſſe towards him. And if it bee falſe, it muſt bee very injurious to the preſent State, and both their royall perſons. And for vs, what temeritie and vncharitable dealing is this in a Ieſuite, to write, That ſo many Catholicke prieſts are Scotiſts in faction, and that without any reſpect of religion at all, they are about to ſet vp the king of Scots, a knowne hereticke, and this to offend now the preſent State? If wee ſhould goe about ſuch an enterpriſe, no doubt, but we ſhould greeuouſly offend the preſent State, no leſſe than the Ieſuites haue done, by their endeuours to ſet vp a Spaniard; it beeing prohibited by the lawes of the realme, vnder a capitall penaltie, That none ſhall meddle with the matter of ſucceſſion, during her Majeſties life that now is; much leſſe, attempt the ſetting vp of any, before her Majeſtie be dead. And in this caſe, if it had been true, perhaps it had not beſeemed Father <hi>Parſons</hi> to haue beene the firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrayer of vs, and diſcouerer of our fault, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by bring vs all in mortall hatred with the State, and in manifeſt daunger of our liues, he knowing that it would ſo mightily offend them. But it being alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether vntrue on our parts, and no other than his owne jealous imagination, hee hath done vs intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable injurie, thus to make vs odious to our owne Prince and State, without our ill deſeruing. I can perceiue no other drift hee ſhould haue in this ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnie, than (all his other deuiſes failing) by this vntrue fiction, to vndoe vs, whom he reckoneth his aduerſaries. He knew when he writ this letter, that wee went about to procure a prohibition, That no bookes or Treatiſes of State-matters ſhould be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:1970:77"/>
which might any way exaſperate her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie and the preſent State againſt vs, which came onely to plant Catholick religion among our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treymen, whoſoeuer they were that ſhould gouerne the kingdome: this I ſay hee knew very well. How then in a charitable mind could he thinke it likely, that we our ſelues were about to ſet vp the king of Scots, which (as he confeſſeth) would moſt of all of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the preſent State? VVee deſired to auoid all occaſions of offence, and this good Father will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe accuſe vs to offend in the higheſt degree. It is not conuenient nor ſafe for vs to follow Father <hi>Parſons</hi> deſignes in theſe matters of princes and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, and therefore he and his aſſociats muſt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don vs, if we diſlike their doings, and quite refuſe to joine with them.</p>

                  <p>It behoueth you to doe no leſſe, eſpecially in theſe daungerous times, when a man ſhall ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard much, and looſe all ere he be aware. But ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Father <hi>Parſons</hi> had ſome notable pollicie in his head about theſe State-affaires, when hee procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, That the Arch-prieſt his authoritie ſhould bee extended ouer all Engliſh prieſts in England and Scotland.</p>

                  <p>Hee had no other, than that by this abſurd meane hee might further the Spaniſh title, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Scots. For when he procured this authoritie, the Catholicke Archbiſhop of Glaſco was liuing, and releeued by the kings conſent and graunt, out of the reuenues of his Biſhopricke. And yet was this Archp. authoritie ſtretched throughout all the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Scotland, without any reſpect or ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation at all to that Archbiſhop; for no other end, but that there ſhould bee no friendſhip, familiaritie, conuerſation, nor communion betweene our prieſts
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:1970:78"/>
and the Catholickes of Scotland, and thereby the people of both nations be kept ſtill at their auncient mortall enmitie.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Gent.</speaker>
                  <p>Mee thinkes this cannot bee but very vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable, and abſurd. For the Engliſh prieſts ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing from his Holineſſe juriſdiction to miniſter Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, as well in Scotland as in England, why ſhould they not as freely (if they bee ſo diſpoſed) helpe to ſaue the Scots, as the Engliſh? Or why ſhould that people for a controuerſie about Titles and Crownes, be debarred of their ſpirituall releefe by our prieſts, conſidering they haue almoſt none of their owne? The worke of God ſhould not be hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered through theſe vaine reſpects. And againe, it ſeemeth, that Father <hi>Parſons</hi> pollicies in temporall matters, blinded his judgement in ſpirituall. For how vnfitting and vnſeemely is it, That an Archprieſt in England ſhould haue his authoritie extended in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the dioceſſe of an Archbiſhop in another king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, without any dependance, or ſubordination vnto him? VVhat can be more injurious both to the Archbiſhop and to the Prieſts, than this? The prieſts be free, and at their owne choice it is, VVhether they will continue and labour in theſe dangerous workes, or leaue them. If wearie of England, they paſſe into Fraunce, Germanie, Spaine, or any other part of Chriſtendome, except Scotland, they are without the Archprieſt his juriſdiction; the Biſhops of thoſe countries may diſpoſe of them: but if for their owne ſafeties, or for deſire of ſauing ſoules, or for any other good reſpect they depart into Scotland, the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke Archbiſhop there cannot diſpoſe of them, not employ them nor hold them, otherwiſe than the Archprieſt in London will giue them leaue; in his power it is, and not in the Arch-biſhops within his
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:1970:78"/>
owne See, what authoritie, and faculties they ſhall haue; whether they ſhall vſe anie part of their fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, or no; and finally, hee may enforce them ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to leaue that kingdome, how needfull ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer they be for Chriſtian ſoules, or elſe to remaine vnable to doe them good, with many moe like in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conueniences.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Prieſt.</speaker>
                  <p>The diſorder is exceeding prepoſterous, and ſhamefull, but thus it pleaſed Father <hi>Parſons</hi> to frame all to his owne purpoſe, without regard either of Prieſts, or Archbiſhops, or Chriſtian ſoules, or Chriſt himſelfe. But to end this point of their ſlaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, with a manifeſt confutation and ſhew of their ill dealing with vs: I pray you conferre this. That wee be Scotiſts in faction, and that wee deale in matters of State, with their other ſlaunder, which wee haue alreadie touched before; that was, That wee are highly fauoured by the State, and maintained by the Councell and Magiſtrates: wee need no more, but for a ſufficient confutation to ſet the one againſt the other. For if it be true, That we be Stateſmen, and goe about to ſet vp the king of Scots; and withall, that this moſt of all doth offend the preſent State (as they ſay;) it cannot ſurely be true, that we are highly fauoured and maintained by the State and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, as they report for our diſgrace: Becauſe the State and Councell will not fauour nor releeue them, that ſo greatly offend them by their dealing in ſtate mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. Or againe, if this latter be true, That the Councel fauour and maintaine vs: it muſt of neceſſitie bee falſe, That we offend them by tampering for the king of Scots. But whiles vndiſcreet zeale and vncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble affections mooue the Ieſuits and their adherents to injurie vs by all meanes they can, they run them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues headlong into theſe abſurdities, to make one
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:1970:79"/>
of their ſlaunders to confute another. For they all beeing vntruths, vttered vpon a mightie ſtomacke, and a vehement deſire to diſcredit vs, they hang to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and agree like <hi>Sampſons</hi> Foxes: but our innocencie and truth I hope will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile in the end againſt all mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, and iniquitie, and cunning ſhifts.</p>
